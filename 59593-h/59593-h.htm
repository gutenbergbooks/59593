<hr class='c007' />
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Scandinavia</span> prior to the tenth century is the
region of romance,—of the wildest legends. These
are admissible into the severe domain of history in
so far only as they illustrate national opinions and
manners,—the noblest part of the study. For this
reason, chiefly, more have been retained in the present
volume than are to be found in any preceding
work on the subject. Indeed, were they rejected,
nine tenths of northern history must be rejected
with them.</p>
<p class='c009'>Another reason for dwelling on the earlier and
more obscure events has been the wish to deviate
as much as possible from a recent popular work in
the “Edinburgh Cabinet Cyclopedia.” Two publications
on the same subject, and designed for the
same class of readers, would scarcely be required,
unless they were distinguished from each other in
their manner of treating it.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the present volume be one of entertainment
chiefly, the next will be one of instruction. The
religion and laws, the manners and opinions, of the
Northmen, will receive their due notice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Inquiries</span> into the origin of nations have never been
productive of much good. Over that of all, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>single exception of the Jews—an exception which we
owe to inspiration—a cloud hangs, that no learning, no
criticism can penetrate. It is easy to be speculative—it
is easy to be ingenious—it is easy to make a considerable
parade of learning by citing the opinions of
various writers, and by attempting to show how little
dependence is to be placed on any one of them; but,
though the vanity of an author may be thus gratified,
his labour must be useless. If he has not authority or
legitimate inference for what he advances, he is worse
than uselessly, he is perniciously employed: he is
wasting his own time and that of his readers, and he
is involving the subject, which he ought to elucidate, in
greater confusion than it was before. Thus every age
and every writer adds to the mass of fable, or at least
of uncertainty, until the truth is for ever hidden beneath
it.</p>
<p class='c009'>These observations especially apply to northern
history. Yet, dark and uncertain as this subject is,
and monstrous as are the hypotheses which native
ingenuity has framed respecting it, curiosity will be
gratified with a mere glimpse at them. Thus, in regard
to the <span class='sc'>Swedes</span>, we shall find their origin wrapt in an
obscurity deep as that which covers the cradle of most
other people. Many are the fables which grave historians,
listening only to tradition, or wresting to a certain
purpose the words of some obscure writer, or confounding
the actions of many people, or misled by a
fancied analogy and similarity of names, have perpetuated
on this subject. That sage authority, the archbishop
of Upsal, has no doubt that Noah was king of
the whole earth; that he settled in Scythia, which was
inhabited a century before Italy; that his son Japhet,
to whom Europe fell, spread his colonies still farther to
the west; that Magog, the son of Japhet, was the first
chief that colonised Sweden and Finland; that from
Sweno, the son of Magog, sprung the Swedes, and from
Gothar or Gog, another son, the Goths; that Thor,
German, and Ubbo, brothers of Sweno, and his great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>vassals, were successful propagators of mankind; that
Ubbo, who succeeded his brother Gothar, founded the
city of Upsal, the most ancient metropolis of the north;
that Siggo, successor of Ubbo, and the fifth king of the
Goths, called Sigtuna into existence; that Eric, grandson
of Gothar, and the sixth king of the Goths, began
to reign about four hundred years after the universal
deluge, and conferred great splendour on those northern
regions; that, after his death, idolatry began in the
north, the magnificent temple of Upsal being erected in
honour of Thor, Odin, Frigga, and other divinities; that
the Swiones or Swedes, and the Gothi or Goths, as
being sprung from different roots, were frequently
under different sceptres, though both regarding themselves
as kindred, and for many generations living in
harmony with each other; that, after the introduction
of idolatry, this peaceful disposition began to be impaired,
and in the course of a few reigns it wholly
disappeared; that the Finns, Jutes, Gothones, Swiones,
and other neighbouring people, became at length so
numerous and so powerful, as to pillage the coasts of
Sweden; that, to oppose them, no less than to procure
the necessaries of life, which long-continued intestine
wars had rendered very scarce, a large army was raised
and a powerful fleet equipped, in about nine hundred
years after the deluge; that the expedition, which
extended along the southern no less than the northern
shores of the Baltic, from Holstein to the confines of
Lithuania, gave rise to a new kingdom; that at this
period the empire of the Goths, comprising so many
people beyond the bounds of Scandinavia, was one of
the most powerful in the world, notwithstanding the
fact that the conquered provinces on the European
continent were subject to their own king (to him who
had led the expedition from Sweden, and to his successors),
while Sweden obeyed another king who had been
left at home with the necessary authority; that the new
empire, the seat of which was in Poland or Hungary,
sent off its conquering swarms into Asia and Egypt;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>that, the regions of the Goths being too extensive for the
government of one man, they at length elected rulers independent
of one another, and thus broke this vast empire
into numerous fragments; that the origin of the Hungarian
dynasty, which was purely Gothic, added to the
weakness of the race; that, while these events were
passing in Europe and Asia, the Swedish monarchy
subsisted, though weakened by the emigration of its
chief warriors; that this diminution, alike of population
and strength, emboldened the Danes, who had hitherto
been tributary to the more northern kingdom, to assume
the offensive, but being themselves assailed by the
Saxons, and unable to resist that martial people, they
eagerly submitted to the Swedes, and chose Dan, a
Swedish prince, the son of Humel, or Humble, the
sixteenth native king of the Goths, to rule over them;
that this prince gave his name to the Danish kingdom,
while his brother Angul, the first king of the <i>English</i>,
left his name to that people; that Dan was succeeded
by Lother his son, and Lother by Skiold,—while,
in Sweden, Humble was followed by Gothilas and
Sigtrug; that Gro, the daughter of Sigtrug, became
the wife of Gram, son of Skiold, king of Denmark,
but contrary to the wishes alike of her father
Sigtrug and of the Swedes; that her abduction by
Gram led to a war between the Danes and the Swedes,
in which the latter were vanquished; that Scarin, the
successor of Sigtrug, was slain in battle by Gram; that,
on his death, Swibdager, king of Norway, was elected
king of the Goths and the Swedes, who detested their
conqueror and the whole Danish nation,—a detestation
which was heartily returned; that, in revenge for the
rape of Gro, a daughter of Gram was carried away into
Norway; that Gram, arming to revenge the injury, was
defeated and slain by Swibdager, who, however, had
the generosity to place Guthrum, son of Gram, over
the Danes; that they remained subject to the Swedes
and Goths until Hadding rose against Asmund, the
twenty-first king of the latter, and delivered his country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>from subjection. For these more recent events, for all
subsequent to Skiold, the good archbishop has scarcely
any other authority than Saxo, the Danish historian,
whose facts, however, he does not scruple to alter whenever
the honour of his country is concerned.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>So much for fable,—at least in regard to the greater
portion of this rapid condensation of the archbishop’s
history. If we had not already had enough of this
ingenious trifling, the <i>Atlantica</i> of Olaus Rudbeck
would supply us with enough to fill many such volumes
as the present. This writer far outdoes the prelate,
whom he exceeds alike in imagination and knowledge of
tradition. To him the reader who may be fond of the
marvellous, who may delight in traditionary lore, and who
may wish to see on how slight a foundation the most
gigantic theories can be erected, may have recourse.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In claims to a remote origin <span class='sc'>Norway</span> is by no means
behind the former kingdom. According to Torfœus,
one of the most learned, and, considering that he lived
in recent times, least critical of mankind, the population
of the whole country has been derived from four distinct
sources. 1. Of these the giants were the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>ancient. These, this historiographer contends to have
been really what they are called, viz., much superior in
bulk to the rest of mankind; and not that evil spirits, by
magical rites, were permitted to effect such appearances.
Though he rejects, as pure romance, the stories of many
giants alleged to have been seen in comparatively modern
times, he is sure that such a race did once inhabit
the north; and he is inclined to derive them from
Shem, the son of Noah. That they once lived, that
their bones are still to be found in several regions of
the world, that they may now live in Patagonia or some
other country, cannot, he thinks, be disputed. We
read of giants in Scripture; who, therefore, can doubt
of their existence? As we have already intimated, he
represents, as old women’s fables, all the stories, however
rife in his time, of giants being produced by the
prince of evil spirits; nor will he allow that they are
the offspring of men and huge beasts. If they did not
spring from either of these causes, they must, necessarily,
have derived their origin from one of Noah’s
sons. Nor can we be surprised at their appearance in
the north of Europe, seeing that we have so many
proofs of their existence in Canaan, Egypt, Greece,
Spain, Britain, and, indeed, all the world over. Their
arrival in the north, however, was no voluntary act;
being expelled from Canaan in the time of Joshua, they
were glad to seek other settlements; and while some
spread themselves throughout northern Africa, northern
and central Europe, and, perhaps, found their way to
America, others directed their steps towards Sweden
and Norway: yet, before the arrival of these exiles,
others of the same race might, for ages, have been in
that peninsula. 2. After the giants, and, indeed, immediately
after them, came the <i>Goths</i>; but the period
cannot be fixed. Joannes Magnus and Rudbeck contend
that it was immediately after the flood; but Torfœus
dares not ascend to so high an antiquity, and he is
satisfied with deriving the Goths from the Trojans, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with referring their arrival in the north to the age in
which Troy was taken. 3. After the Goths came the
<i>Asae</i>, or <i>Scythians</i>, whom he holds to be the third distinct
race of men that helped to people the north.
These were the followers of Odin, whose empire, at
once spiritual and temporal, attested <i>his</i> policy and <i>their</i>
prowess. 4. Yet it may be doubted whether these
were the sole, or even the original, colonisers of Norway.
The people of this as of every other country must
have their indigenous families, or families, at least, who
were here long before any strangers arrived. Thus, a
certain man, Forniot by name, had three sons: Hler,
ruler of the winds; Logi, lord of fire; Karl, sovereign
of the sea. Snaer was the grandsire of this last-named
monarch, and a celebrated prince he was. He had one
son, Thor, and three daughters, Faunna, Drifa, and
Miollis. Thor was more powerful than the father,
since he reigned over the whole of the northern part of
the Scandinavian peninsula, including Finland; and
divine honours were paid to him by at least one great
tribe of his subjects. Thor had three children, Nor
and Gor, who were males, and Goe, a daughter. This
princess being stolen away, her two brothers went in
pursuit of her. Nor went westward, subduing and
killing many native kings, among whom were Hemming
and Hunding: in short, he conquered the whole of
Norway, to which he gave his name. The ravisher of
Goe was Rolf, or Rollo, the son of a great prince, who
submitted to Thor, and whose sister, Hodda, had
the honour to become that monarch’s bride. While
he was performing these feats, his brother Gor was
subduing all the islands of the Baltic and of the Icy
Ocean, which constituted his dominion. The sons of
Nor divided the vast region among themselves; hence
the many separate principalities which were so long the
bane of Norway.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>No reader will be at a loss to perceive that this
fourth race of men is a mythologic creation. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>rulers of the elements, fire, water, wind,—<i>Snaer</i>, or
snow; <i>Jokul</i>, or frost; <i>Faunn</i>, or frozen snow; <i>Snifa</i>,
or sleet,—with many others, sufficiently attest this
curious fact. Whether the Norwegians invented these
elemental gods first, and called their mortal heroes after
them; or whether they elevated those heroes after death
to the dignity of local gods, we shall not attempt to
discuss. The probability is, that in this country, the
march of the human mind was the same as in other
countries, viz., that men celebrated for their great qualities
were believed to have originally sprung from a
divine source, and after this life to return to that source;
to be invested in another state with a superiority akin
to that which they enjoyed in this. As to a northern
inhabitant, the sea and the winds were the most important
elements, so the deities that they obeyed were
the most powerful, the most dreaded, the most worshipped.
Every page of the earliest Norwegian history
(or fable, if the reader pleases) bears evidence to this
inference, that long prior to the arrival of the Goths in
that region there was a religion quite distinct from that
which followed it; one of truly primitive character,
which admitted of no refinement, which dealt with
sensible objects, which appealed to the fears and hopes
of mankind. The honour in which Thor, the father of
Nor, and the common ancestor of all the Norwegian
princes, was held, sufficiently accounts for his superiority
over Odin himself, in the religious creed of that people.
The Danes and Swedes held the former, the Norwegians
the latter, to be the supreme god,—supreme, at least,
as far as the government of this world is concerned.
Hence there must, at some period subsequent to Odin’s
arrival, have been an amalgamation of the two religions.
If the successors of Odin in Denmark and Sweden
forced the Norwegians to acknowledge him as a divinity,
and to place his statue with that of Thor, it is manifest
that they only paid him a secondary veneration; Thor
sitting in state, surrounded by all the attributes of
majesty, while the warrior god—the foreign Asiatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>god—was made to stand beside him. On this subject,
however, more in the proper place.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Denmark</span> is, in no respect, behind either Sweden or
Norway in its claims to antiquity. In the valuable
collection of Langebek, we find a list of monarchs in
Icelandic<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> as old, at least, as the tenth century, sufficiently
ample for the vanity of any nation. It begins
with Noah; passes down through the intervening generations
to Odin, “that king of the Turks whom the
Romans forced towards the north;” and ends with
Hardecanute. Another branch of the same list deduces
the regal genealogy from Odin to Harald Harfagre,
the well-known monarch of Norway.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In both cases,
the names must be considered as strictly belonging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to the Asiatic potentates, who were never alleged to
have set foot in the north of Europe. During
<i>their</i> reigns, fabulous or true, Scandinavia was not
without its petty kings, or, if the reader pleases, hereditary
chieftains, whose authority was similar to the
patriarchal. Their names are given by Saxo Grammaticus
and other native writers, who, following their
own traditionary songs, knew little of the Asiatic predecessors
of Odin, and were therefore unable to enumerate
them. Thus, too, with the Swedes, who, as we
have seen, had their internal, no less than their external,
kings,—their domestic, no less than their foreign, potentates.
Hence, in all these states, two distinct races
of rulers,—the native and the foreign,—the former
indigenous, the latter wholly strangers, to the regions
of northern Europe.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That the Goths were resident in the north of Europe
before the times which we denominate historic,—that
they had for ages, perhaps, been there when the Romans
came into contact with them, is very probable.
“Many vestiges,” says Gibbon, “which cannot be
ascribed to popular vanity, attest the residence of the
Goths in the countries beyond the Baltic.” Still no
man in the least conversant with antiquity—unless,
indeed, like Joannes Magnus and Rudbeck, he has prejudices
which no information can remove—will contend
that they were the <i>first</i> settlers: it may even be
doubted whether they constituted the second immigration
into those regions. The Cimmerians, or Cimbri, were
in Jutland, at least, before them; but whether even these
were the first people that forsook their Asiatic abodes for
western Europe is very doubtful: probably they were preceded
by some other swarms whose very name time has
destroyed, just as <i>they</i> were the predecessors of the Celts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>a race sprung from themselves. The Finns and the
Lapps, whose manners, language, and character are so
different from those of the other European nations, are
probably tribes of some race which arrived in more
southern regions at a period lost in the depth of antiquity;
and which the hostile incursions of Cimmerians,
Celts, Goths, and other barbarians, exiled into
the snows of the north.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Such are the conclusions of reason. They are not opposed
to authority. What ancient history really informs
us concerning the people of the north may be comprised
in a few lines. They were split into tribes; and of these
the <i>Swiones</i>—the Swiar of the middle ages—were the
most conspicuous. They were a rich and powerful maritime
nation; and, if Tacitus is to be credited, their
kings were despotic. Lest they should turn against one
another, or, what was worse, against their rulers, their
arms were taken from them, and kept by the royal slaves.
They were, no doubt, a tribe which inhabited Sweden.
In the same region were the <i>Guttones</i>, or Goths, another
tribe, probably, of more ancient arrival. As the lands of
the two were conterminous, the Swiones must have often
called on their king for weapons, unless, indeed, their
enemies, too, had been disarmed. But this alleged disarming
is pure fable, and we know not how Tacitus could
be so thoughtless as to relate it. The <i>Dankiones</i>—probably
the Danskir or Danes—bordered on the Guttones.
Whether they were confined merely to the islands now
forming the Danish monarchy, or were also spread over,
at least, part of Jutland, may be disputed. If, by Cadononia,
Tacitus really means the peninsula, the Teutones
were also there. There can be no doubt that all these
tribes were kindred: they all came from Asiatic Scythia,
however different the periods of their arrival. But, in
regard to the <i>Fenni</i>, who are manifestly the Finns, he
doubts whether he should call them a Teutonic or a
Sarmatian tribe. Ptolemy locates them in western
Lithuania; Tacitus, more to the north; and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the close affinity which a modern Polish professor has
established between the Letts and the Finns, we may
safely infer that they are of the same origin. Probably
the stream of colonisation passed from Livonia across
the gulf.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The distinction of tribes inhabiting northern Europe
being granted, and authentic history assuring us that
the Scythian Goths were the last people that reached
western Europe,—the Slavi, their hereditary enemies,
scarcely penetrating to the centre,—we naturally inquire,
“At what period did they arrive?” Most antiquaries
of the north, as we have already shown, have
not hesitated to affirm that it was immediately after the
deluge, and, consequently, that the Goths were the
original inhabitants. Other writers, however, are satisfied
with a more recent origin, and place this arrival
about two thousand years before Christ. Others, again,
are willing to deduct a full millenium from this latter
antiquity; but it may be doubted whether a single
tribe of Goths had set foot in the north five centuries
before Odin’s arrival. Few tribes of them were probably
there when he introduced a new faith. The
opposition which his followers encountered in their
political, no less than their religious character,—in
their conquests no less than their preaching,—confirms
this supposition; and the fact that nearly all the
kings of the north boasted of their descent from some
one of Odin’s royal sons, almost elevates this hypothesis
to the dignity of an historic fact. As the Goths—both
those who accompanied Odin and those who had
preceded him—were the conquering and, therefore,
the dominant caste, the sceptre was generally held
by princes of that nation; the conquerors were comparatively
few in number; and the original inhabitants,
though they constituted the bulk of the population,
were constrained to bend in sullen acquiescence before
the power of the strangers. By degrees, the amalgamation
of these strangers with the former race (or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>perhaps, races) produced that form of society peculiar
to the north. The more we reflect on this subject the
more we incline to the opinion that prior to the Odinic
times the Goths were not very numerous in Scandinavia.
They might have kings four or five centuries before
Christ; probably there were immigrations of Goths
from Asia before even that period; still there is more
safety, because more reason, in the conclusion that,
from remote antiquity to the arrival of Odin, the bulk
of the population in those countries were of native, that
is, of Finnish or Jutish stock, and that the sons of the
Asiatic conqueror were the first Gothic <i>monarchs</i> of the
north.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That the original inhabitants, whether Finns, or
Jutes, or Laplanders, or a combination of all the three,
differed widely from the Gothic conquerors, in language,
manners, religion, and character, is certain. The
earliest poems of the latter—those traditionary relics
of a far more ancient age—are filled with allusions to
this distinction. They represent the Finns and Lapps as
magicians, as invested with uncontrollable authority over
the elements; and the Jutes as at once giants and magicians.
But the warriors of Odin arrogated to themselves
no such powers, though their priests might. Legend,
indeed, records some instances in which these powers were
communicated to fortunate Gothic heroes; but the old
inhabitants were the teachers, and what knowledge they
imparted—which was always grudgingly imparted—was
little in comparison with that which they retained.
In the old Sagas, in the collection of Snorro Sturleson,
in Saxo Grammaticus, and even in later authorities, we
everywhere discover a marked antipathy between the
victors and the vanquished. It originated in a twofold
cause,—in the difference of religion no less than
that of race; and it was embittered in the same degree
that it was perpetuated by mutual hostilities. The
Finn, indeed, was unable to cope with the powerful
Goth; but this sense of inferiority sharpened his invention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and made his hostility to be dreaded in proportion
to its secrecy. The blow was struck in darkness; and
the Goth, who had a sovereign contempt for the valour
of his foe, was led to attribute it to supernatural rather
than to human agency.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We have already seen the meagre sum of information
which Tacitus has bequeathed to us respecting
the state of the north in his time. For many centuries
afterwards, no great additions were made to it.
In the fifth we learn that between the Elbe and the
Baltic—no doubt, too, on both sides of that river, to
some extent—were Angles, Jutes, and Saxons. Of these
the first had no other seat. The second were doubtless
a bastard colony from the more northern parts of the
peninsula; and the last were an offset from the great
Saxon confederation. The Jutes were the fewest in
number; yet they were the progenitors of the men of
Kent and the Isle of Wight, and of a tribe among the
West Saxons. The rest of the Saxons—West, East,
and South — were derived from the Saxon division of
the colonists. The Angles gave their name to the
people who bore it (the East Angles and Middle
Angles) and likewise to the Mercians and Northumbrians.
Such, according to that venerable authority
the Saxon Chronicle, was the connection between these
people and our island. But, reverting to the state of
northern Europe after the time of Tacitus, yet before
geography made us well acquainted with it, king
Alfred, in his epitome of Orosius, adds some particulars
which he had learned from his own inquiries. These
particulars he derived from Otter, a Norwegian, and
Wulfstan, a Danish seaman. The former said that he
lived north of all the Northmen, in Halgoland, opposite
to the west sea; that north of him there was an
immense waste land, some parts of it, however, being
visited by the Finns for hunting in summer and fishing
in winter; that he had once sailed round the North
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Cape to the White Sea, and on the coast had found a
people called Beormas, who spoke a kindred language
with the Finns. “This Otter,” says the king, “was
a rich man, according to the opinion of his own country:
he had 600 tame deer, and six decoy ones, whose
value in catching the wild deer was incalculable: hence
these decoy deer were much esteemed by the Finns.”
But this Norwegian captain had not above twenty head
of horned cattle, and as many sheep and swine. The
Finns paid rent in skin, feathers, whalebone, and ropes
for shipping. (The proprietors of these lands were evidently
Goths, the conquering tribe.) Otter further
said, that the country of the Northmen (Norway) was
long and narrow, cultivated on the sea coast, but to the
east overlooked by wild barren mountains. Yet Finns
inhabited them even in the ninth century,—a proof that
they were tributary to these Goths, especially as we
may infer from this Norwegian’s account that they
were the only people that paid rent: the dominant
race were freeholders. Opposite to this country of
the Northmen, in the south, was <i>Swevland</i>, or Sweden;
and to the north, the country opposite was
<i>Cwenaland</i>, or that portion of the region between the
Gulf of Bothnia and Mount Sevo. “These Cwenas,”
says Otter, “frequently assailed the Northmen, and the
Northmen were no less inclined to pass the mountains
against the Cwenas. From Halgoland, where Otter
dwelt, to the north of the land inhabited by the Northmen,
is a great distance,—so great that no one could
reach it by sea in a month.” To be brief, the whole
course of the navigation from the extremity of Norway
to the south of Jutland, is so minutely described, as to
render it impossible for any one to mistake the localities
intended, or to refuse credit to the relation of
this old Norwegian navigator.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The distinction, for which we have given some reasons,
between the various tribes of the north, is now
acknowledged by all the native writers, and by all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>foreigners, who have paid much attention to the subject.
“The followers of the historic Odin,” says a living
writer, “were the Sviar, known unto Tacitus under the
name of Suiones; and the inhabitants whom they found
in the country were another tribe of Goths, who had
emigrated thither at a remote period, veiled from the
eye of history. The primitive people by whom it was
occupied, were the Jötnar and Dwarfs; the Feuni of
Tacitus; the Skrithfiuni of Procopius, and the Cwenas
and Finnas mentioned by the Norwegian navigator
to king Alfred. They were gradually expelled, and
driven further north, towards the arctic circle, by the
Goths and Sviar, with whom they maintained perpetual
war, embittered by religious rancour, often represented,
in the fictions of the northern age, under the allegory
of a contest between the celestial deities and the giants
or evil genii.” But of this subject more hereafter,
when we come to the exploits and policy of Odin.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Of the Scandinavians, prior to the arrival of Odin,
and, indeed, for centuries after that event, little, as far
as regards their domestic history, is known. Rejecting
wholly, as fabulous, the boast of native writers, that
they had <i>monarchs</i> centuries before the foundation of
Rome; we may, however, admit that they had kings—or,
if the reader pleases, local judges—in time of peace,
and military chieftains in war. There is reason to
think that their chieftains, who assumed the regal title,
were at one period, and, indeed, generally, exceedingly
numerous. “At this time,” says a chronicler, speaking
of the age following our Saviour’s birth, “there
were <i>many</i> kings in the north.” Sweden had a dozen
of them; Norway no fewer than eighteen; Jutland
had usually two; and the various islands composing
the rest of the Danish monarchy, had each one. As in
the heroic age of Greece, so in that of Scandinavia, the
same condition of society produced the same form of
government. Of these reguli, some were probably
hereditary, some elective; some were certainly principal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>others tributary. This distinction was the result,
first, of some fancied superiority in the family of certain
princes, but in a greater degree of their superior success.
In Norway, for instance, the Finnish family
of Fornjoter (Forniot) was esteemed the most ancient,
and was that to which all the princes of that
country referred their origin. But let us not forget
that little dependence is to be placed on the alleged
progenitors of these reguli, or the names of the reguli
themselves, or their respective order of succession,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
or on the deeds attributed to them. All is darkness,
uncertainty, contradiction. In the history of Norway,
for instance, we are referred to Swedish kings as contemporary,
whom the history of the latter kingdom
places many generations before or after the alleged
period. This is more strikingly the case in regard to
the Danish and Swedish kings. In the history of
the one we are referred to that of the other; yet the
latter, in a majority of cases, have not one syllable on
the subject. Names and events, on which the destinies
of each country seems to turn, are mentioned by one
class of historians, and passed over by another as
having had no existence. But if so little reliance is to
be placed on these regal successions, we must not lose
sight of the fact, that were they and the events
ascribed to them wholly fabulous (yet wholly fabulous
they are not, since tradition does not so much
create as amplify and distort), they would still demand
our attention. Reject them, and nine tenths of northern
history must be rejected with them. And these traditionary
songs, which form the entire history of the
north, deserve our notice in another respect—they supply
us with the best, the only picture of national manners.
For this reason, we shall cast a hasty glance at the
more remarkable events which Saxo represents as prior
to the Odinic times, but which, in fact, were subsequent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the Swedish and Norwegian history, during this
fabulous or mythologic, or, at best, doubtful period, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>have little information beyond what is afforded us by
the historian of Denmark, and he only mentions them
incidentally. Not so in regard to the Danish themselves,
which, thanks to his romantic bias and untiring
industry, are sufficiently well known to us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prior to the reign of <i>Dan</i>, the son of Humble,
Denmark, like the whole of the north, was subject to
chiefs—whether hereditary or elective we need not
inquire. But such a form of government had its evils.
A hundred tyrants were more galling than one; and
Dan, who gave his name to the nation, was invested
with an authority superior to the other chiefs, and with
the regal title. On his death, the sceptre passed by
election, and not by inheritance, into the hands of his
son <i>Humble</i>; but the people found that monarchy, too,
has its curses, though they are neither so numerous nor
so great as those inseparable from an aristocracy.
<i>Lother</i>, the brother of Humble, revolted, was victorious,
and enabled to usurp the regal dignity. As he
had been a rebellious subject, so he made a tyrannical
king. The most illustrious of the Danes he deprived
of property or life, until a conspiracy served him as he
had served so many others. <i>Skiold</i>, the son of Lother,
was raised to the vacant dignity, a proof (always supposing
the traditionary guides of Saxo to be worthy of
credit) that the hereditary principle has great force
even in the most ancient forms of society; indeed, the
application of this principle to the chief magistracy of
the state, is the natural and almost inevitable result of
the patriarchal system—a system which we all know to
be coëval with the existence of the world. Skiold was
the Hercules of his age; and at a time when wild
beasts disputed with man the empire of the forest, he
was a greater benefactor than if he were merely a
warrior. Even in his youth he was a prodigy; he
would seize and fetter the most savage bear, leaving to
his followers the less noble task of despatching the
monster. Yet he frequently struggled with the bravest
of his own species; no wrestler of Scandinavia could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>withstand him; in a single combat, he overthrew the
duke of the Alemanni or Swabians, his army and that
of his enemy being spectators; reduced that people to
the condition of tributaries, and returned home in
triumph, accompanied by the daughter of the duke,
the beautiful Awilda, whom he made the partner of his
throne. Nor was he less distinguished for wisdom than
for valour. He was a legislator: bad laws he abolished,
and enacted such as were required by an
improved state of society. He was a great friend to
the poor and the afflicted; the debts of others he often
paid from his own treasury; the spoils taken in battle
he uniformly abandoned to his followers; and it was
one of his noble sayings, that, while money was the
reward of the soldier, glory was enough for the general.
So much esteemed, indeed, was this prince, that his
posterity were glad to derive additional distinction from
his name; and the Skioldungs, or the descendants of
Skiold, were long dear to Denmark.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Gram</i>, the son of Skiold, and the fifth king, was
endowed with equal strength and equal enterprise, and
his life was more romantic. His first consort was the
daughter of his tutor or governor, a grim old chief;
but thinking this lady beneath him, or, more probably,
anxious to reward his brother in arms, Bessus, he soon
bestowed her upon that hero. The dearer the gift,
the greater the merit of the action; nor are similar
instances of liberality wanting in other pagan heroes of
the north. Probably Gram undervalued a conquest so
easy as the wife he thus presented to his friend; and his
ambition was roused by the hope of obtaining a lady
whom nothing short of the highest courage could win.
Gro, the daughter of Sigtrug, king of the Swedes, had
been affianced to a giant, viz., a Jute or a Finn. Indignant
at this prostitution of royal blood and virgin
modesty, the Danish monarch, attended by his never-failing
companion, Bessus, passed into Sweden, killed the
relatives of Gro, subdued the country, and brought away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the princess in triumph.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> But, with all his valour, Gram
was inconstant. Leading his army against the king of
the Finns, he was so struck with the beauty of that
monarch’s daughter, that he was speedily converted from
an enemy into a suitor; and he obtained a promise of
her hand on the condition of repudiating Gro. Scarcely,
however, had he left the Finnish territory, when a
Saxon duke arrived, courted the lady, and the nuptial
day was appointed. But he was not of a temper to
bear this insult. Leaving his troops, he repaired
silently and quickly into Finland, assumed a mean disguise,
entered the royal palace, and took a humble seat.
Being asked what brought him there, he replied, his
profession as leech—a character held sacred in all
ancient communities, and sure of access to every house.
As he had expected, the assembled guests were soon
steeped in drunkenness. According to the manner of
the times, he sung his own exploits, beheaded the
unsuspecting bridegroom, prostrated many of the attendants
to the earth, and bore away the princess to his
vessel, which awaited him on the coast. But his end
was fatal. By Swibdager, king of Norway, he was
deprived of empire and of life; his dominions became
the prize of the victor; and his two infant sons, Guthrum
and Hadding, were secretly carried to Sweden, and
confided to the charge of two giants.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Here Saxo is careful to explain what he means by
the word <i>giant</i>. There were, he assures us, three
species. First, there were the vulgar giants; those
who excelled all mankind in bodily stature. Next,
were the wise men, who were as much inferior to the
former in bulk, as they were superior in knowledge:
these penetrated into the secret workings of nature, and
were enemies of the monster giants, whom they subdued.
Like the Persian magi, they struggled for, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>obtained, the chief power of the state wherever they
settled, and arrogated to themselves a divine, no less
than a regal, authority; in short, they were expert magicians,
able to delude all mankind by their prestiges.
Next, we have the third class of giants, who were the
offspring of the two preceding, and were inferior to one
parent in magnitude of body, to the other in knowledge;
yet, in both respects, they were above the ordinary
standard of our nature, and were thought, by their
deluded admirers, to inherit some portion of divinity.
After this sage distinction, the Danish ecclesiastic
observes, that we ought not to be surprised at the
credulity of the northmen, for were not the Romans,
though the wisest of men, equally credulous? Whatever
may be thought of that distinction, or of the personages
whom he has drawn from everlasting obscurity,
of the existence of this credulity we have abundant
evidence; and it furnishes one of the best comments
on the manners and opinions of the times.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Swibdager</i>, the conqueror of Gram, and the sixth
king of Denmark, found the weight of three crowns too
much for one brow. At the entreaty, therefore, of Gro,
the divorced queen of Gram, he recalled her son
Guthrum from exile, and placed him, as a vassal, on
the throne. This prince was naturally despised as the
slave of a foreign prince. Not so his brother <i>Hadding</i>,
who, preferring liberty to a dependent court, and the
hope of avenging his father’s death to the smiles of that
father’s murderer, remained in exile, and with him
were the hearts of Denmark. Of all the ancient
heroes of the monarchy, this is, perhaps, the most celebrated.
Wondrous, indeed, were his actions. While
a youth, he inflamed the heart of Hardgrip, the giant
daughter of his giant foster-father, who urged him to
make a corresponding return. How could he love a
giantess? Was he—whom she could, almost, inclose
in one of her hands—a fit match for her? The
thing was impossible. “By no means,” was the reply.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“We of the superhuman breed can change, at pleasure,
our forms, and even our substances; in short, we can
reach the clouds, or reduce ourselves to your size.”
The royal youth consented; and never had man a more
useful or more faithful companion. Her magical knowledge
was of more avail to him than her valour, for in
that he could equal her; but she could furnish him
with superior weapons, defend him from unseen danger,
and cure his wounds where human aid would have
been useless. At length, perceiving that he yearned to
revisit his native country, she resolved to accompany
him. On their journey, they one night arrived at a
house where a corpse was duly laid out, until the mournful
funeral rites were celebrated. Here was an opportunity
of consulting the will of the gods, and the magic
giantess availed herself of it. Producing a piece of
wood on which certain verses of might, in Runic characters,
were inscribed<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, she caused it to be placed
under the tongue of the deceased by Hadding. The
effect was instantaneous: the corpse began to speak,
and to utter the direst anathemas on her who had disturbed
the repose of the dead. It predicted her immediate
destruction in a neighbouring wood. No sooner,
indeed, had they reached the wood, and erected their
tent for the night, than a huge hand was seen to move
around them. The terrified Hadding called on his
companion for help; and she, dilating her body to a
great extent, was able to seize the hand, and present it
for amputation to the prince. From the wound issued
more venom than blood. But the victory was dearly
purchased; the gigantic witch was torn to pieces by
the irritated powers of darkness. “Neither her supernatural
condition,” says Saxo, “nor her vast bulk,
availed her.” Hadding, however, did not much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>suffer by the event: a wise old man with one eye,
pitying his disconsolate situation, provided him with a
brother in arms, a celebrated pirate, and both entered
into what was considered the holiest of compacts in
the manner of the times, viz., each besmeared the footsteps
of the other with his own blood. The two heroes
being conquered by a chief on whom they made war,
the same old man took Hadding on horseback to his
own mysterious seat, and both renovated and prodigiously
fortified him by a magic drink. At the same
time a metrical prophecy told him how he was to escape
from the captivity which impended over him. Who
was this unknown benefactor? On his return to the
place whence he was taken, he could perceive, through
the folds of his mantle, that he was conveyed over the
sea. The horse which bore him was evidently a demon,
obedient to Odin, the god of the north.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>After some great exploits in the east, to which his
ardour, no less than his fear of Swibdager, bore him,
Hadding returned to Scandinavia. In a sea-fight he
defeated and slew his enemy, and thus became sovereign
of Denmark, or, we should say, of the Danish islands,—for
Jutland and Scania obeyed different princes.
Asmund, the son of Swibdager, he thus transformed
into a foe, and a foe, too, greatly to be dreaded. In a
battle which ensued, finding that the tide of success
was against him, he silently invoked the aid of the
wizard giant Wagnoft, the father of his deceased mistress,
Hardgrip. Wagnoft obeyed the spell, and was
immediately by his side. Asmund lost the battle, and
fell; but in his last moments he had the satisfaction of
knowing that he had rendered Hadding lame for life.
And he had another kind of joy, dear enough to a
pagan: his wife Gunhilda, disdaining to survive him,
slew herself with his sword, and was laid in the same
grave with him. An invasion of his own country
by Uffo, the son of Asmund, prevented Hadding from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>pursuing his advantage; but the following spring
he again invaded Sweden; but his ranks were thinned,
alike, by famine and disease. His men were obliged to
feed on their horses; next, on their dogs; and, lastly,
on each other. To increase their consternation, a nocturnal
voice assured them of great evils. The following
night, even, another unknown voice threatened the
Swedes with destruction. Both armies, therefore, were
alarmed; each had a supernatural enemy, while each
was perhaps unconscious that it had, also, a supernatural
friend. That same night the two armies engaged;
when, behold! two aged men, of a form larger than the
human, were seen by the light of the stars in the battle,—one
for the Swedes, the other for the Danes. The
latter were subdued, and their king glad to flee to his
own country. But misfortune pursued him. One day,
as he was cooling his limbs in the waters of the sea, he
perceived a fish different from any that he had ever
seen; as it was near the shore, he killed it, and it was
taken to his camp. But what was his consternation
when a sea-nymph appeared, and denounced direct
vengeance on his head! He had killed one of the gods
under the form of a fish. Henceforth the elements
should be hostile to him; if he ventured on the deep,
his vessel should be wrecked by the fury of the tempest;
on land, the house which received him should, by a
tempest, also be levelled with the ground; his flocks
should perish in the fields; every place which he visited
should be cursed for his sake: and this dreadful doom
was to remain in force until he had propitiated the
divine wrath by frequent sacrifices. The mandate was
not to be despised; during the course of a year altars
perpetually smoked with oxen immolated to Fro, the
awful deity of the winds.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The life of Hadding was full of portents and marvels.
Scarcely had he rescued the princess Regnilda of
Norway from the obligation of marrying a giant, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>killing the monster, and making her his bride, than
a most wonderful adventure befell him. One winter
evening, as he was supping with his bride, a woman
like a culler of simples was seen to raise her head from
the ground close by the hearth, and inquired whether
the king did not wish to know where such herbs grew
at that season of the year. He replied, that he should
very much wish to know. Hearing this, she enveloped
him in his own mantle, and sank with him into the
ground. What they saw in this subterranean journey
bears some resemblance to the descriptions which have
been given us of the Scandinavian world of spirits.
They first entered a dark path, worn out by the feet of
many travellers, and here they perceived some great
ones of the earth,—some in purple and gold,—whose
doom appeared to consist in their indefinite windings.
Passing them, they entered a region of some fertility,
whence the woman had derived her simples. Farther
still, they reached a river of precipitate course and black
waters, which rolled along the weapons of many heroes,
and over which a bridge conducted them to a different
region. One of the first objects that met their eyes
was two armies engaged in deadly strife. “Who are
these?” demanded Hadding. “These,” replied the
sorceress, “are they who fell in battle; and it is their
delight in this world continually to imitate their martial
deeds in the other.” At length they reached a high
wall, totally impassable. The woman, indeed, made no
attempt to scale it; but, twisting off the head of a cock
which she had brought with her, she threw it over;
when, behold! the cock began to crow as if nothing
had been done to it! Unable to proceed further, the
adventurous travellers returned to the palace.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The rest of this monarch’s life must be hastily
despatched. He triumphed over Uffo, who fell in
battle, and bestowed the vacant throne of Sweden on
Hunding, brother of the deceased monarch. His last
days were embittered by the unnatural conduct of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>daughter Ulwilda, who, with her husband, planned his
destruction. Though he escaped all the snares of his
enemies, at length he laid violent hands upon himself,
leaving the throne of Denmark, and the superiority over
that of Sweden, to his eldest son, Frode I.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Frode I.</i> was also a great warrior, and he carried his
depredations from Russia to the British islands, on
which, unfortunately for the natives, he made a longer
stay than kings, whose sole object was plunder, were
accustomed to make. If there were any truth in the
Danish account of this period, Scotland and South
Britain were in frequent intercourse with the northern
kingdom,—sometimes for war and sometimes for
peace. But these accounts are all to be distrusted.
Events which happened at a much later period have
been removed to the one before us; and the basis has
been so much overlaid by fable, that no ingenuity can
separate the true from the false.—When Frode commenced
his reign, he found the treasury empty. How
replenish it? By an expedient frequently to be found
in Scandinavian legends. On a solitary island, a dragon,
formidable alike for size and venom, brooded over immense
riches. The youthful monarch hastened to the
spot, entered the cave, fought and killed the serpent,
and brought away the golden hoard. Whether there
be any meaning in this and similar fables has been
much disputed: probably, however, it had a foundation,
and the dragon may have been some terrible pirate
whom Frode destroyed, and whose subterraneous riches
he seized. This unexpected supply, we are told,
enabled him to pursue his expeditions on various coasts
of Europe. But we have no inclination to follow him.
We may, however, allude to the way in which he
gained possession of London; because the same expedient
is often to be found in northern writers. Despairing
of the reduction of a place so well defended, he
caused a report to be spread that he had suddenly died
in his tent. Permission was asked to bury him in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of the temples of the city, and was granted. On the
day appointed, the pretended corpse was borne through
the gates; a great number of Danes attended to do
honour to their monarch; but, under the garb of
mourning, they hid their weapons of war; and, on a
signal being given, they threw off the mockery of woe,
assailed the Britons, and took the city by surprise.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Of the immediate successors of this monarch little is
known. <i>Haldan</i>, his son, was a great warrior, who
put his own brother to death, and was hated by the
people. <i>Roe</i>, the son of Haldan, was a quiet prince,
mean in stature, but with a mind whose care it was to
make his subjects happy. <i>Helge</i><a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a>, his brother and
successor, with whom, during his own life, he had
shared the throne, was also a prince of great qualities;
but his vices were still greater. “Whether his lust or
his tyranny were more intolerable,” says the historian,
“is very doubtful.” His amours are too disgusting to
be recorded. At length, seeing the execration in which
he was held, he bade adieu to his country; and it proved
a final adieu. According to report, he fell on his own
sword. In the reigns of these princes, we have no
mention of the Norwegian sovereigns; but those of
Sweden—let us not forget that it is a Dane who writes—are
represented as still dependent on Denmark.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
<i>Rolf</i> (or Rollo) succeeded his father, and was much
beloved by his subjects.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a> He fell through the
treachery of a brother-in-law, who was excited
to the deed by the sister of Rolf. Daughters conspiring
against fathers, sisters against brothers, wives
against husbands, are among the common events of
Scandinavian history. As this prince died without
issue, the Danish states elected for their monarch
<i>Hoder</i>, a descendant of the famous Hadding, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>been educated by Gewar, a king of Norway. As it is
in the reign of this latter monarch that Odin is again
introduced on the stage of northern history,—his first
appearance being referred by Saxo to the time of
Hadding,—we can no longer refuse to notice what
antiquity records with respect to him. In this, as in
other parts of this introduction, the reader may admit
or reject what he pleases.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>According to Saxo, this personage was a mortal, king
of the Hellespont, who laid claim to the honours of
divinity, and was actually worshipped by most of
Europe. His profound knowledge of magic procured
him the character. His ordinary residence was Byzantium;
but he held Upsal, which he frequently visited,
in much esteem. Anxious to testify their respect for
this new deity, the kings of the north cast a golden
statue in his honour, adorned it with bracelets and
other costly ornaments, and sent it to Byzantium. It
was received by Odin with great joy, and placed in the
temple of the gods. But Frigga, the wife of Odin,
whom Saxo judges to be quite worthy of such a
husband, stript the statue of its ornaments to adorn
herself. The incensed deity hung the mechanics who
acted by her orders; and, for greater security, placed
the image on a high pedestal, and, by his wonderful
art, rendered it vocal to human touch. But when was
female vanity cured? To secure the aid of a domestic
of the temple, Frigga did not hesitate to grant him the
last favour; and, by his aid, the gold being again
abstracted, again adorned her person. This twofold
injury was too much for a god to withstand; and Odin
left the country for a season, until the public discourse,
like a nine days’ wonder, had evaporated itself into
empty air. During his absence, several persons—probably
priests of his own temple—arrogated to themselves
the attributes of divinity. These, on his return,
he forced not only to lay down their borrowed honours,
but to flee from the country. Among them, one is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>mentioned whose case affords a curious illustration of
popular superstition. Mitothin was a great magician,
and had long enjoyed the favour of the gods. But
they were incensed with his impiety, while he no
longer paid them the slightest homage. On the return
of Odin he fled to Fionia, and was killed by the
inhabitants. In his tomb, however, he was amply
revenged: he introduced into the whole region various
kinds of plague; he destroyed multitudes of the inhabitants;
until they, one day, opened his sepulchre,
exhumed his body, cut off his head, and drove a stake
through the corpse: then the mysterious visitation was
at an end. He is, probably, the first vampire on record.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The account of Snorro Sturleson, who followed Norwegian,
not Danish authorities, differs in many respects
from the preceding. He informs us that the seat of
Odin’s power, both temporal and spiritual, was Asgard,
a place of extraordinary sanctity east of the Tanais.
Over the temple were twelve pontiffs, whose duty was
the twofold one of sacrificing and administering the
laws: they were called <i>driar</i> or <i>drottnar</i>,—lords,—and
were held in much veneration. At the head of this
theocratic state was Odin, who was at perpetual war
with his neighbours, and on whose arms success always
shone. So great, indeed, was this success, that he was
called the father of victory. When he sent out his
generals on any expedition, he was accustomed to lay
his hands on their heads and predict a fortunate issue
to the undertaking. Hence the peculiar veneration
attached to his character. His followers regarded him
as a god; in dangers and perils of any kind—on land,
on deep—whether he were present or absent—they
invoked his name, and ascribed all their prosperity to
him. His expeditions, even to remote countries, were
frequent; and during his absence the sovereignty was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>administered by his two brothers. The Vanir, who
are said to have been his neighbours, he so harassed,
that they sued for peace: the conditions were framed,
and hostages given for their punctual observance.
Niord the Rich, and Freyr his son, were surrendered
by the Vanir; Haenir and Mimir by the Asser. In
a short time, however, the former perceiving that their
confidence was abused by the hostages of Odin, cut off
the head of Mimir and sent it to Asgard. By his
magic art, Odin so enchanted the head that it became
his oracle: it conversed with him whenever he pleased,
and acquainted him with many hidden things, both of
nature and of fate. Niord and Freyr, he won over to
his own interests by investing them with the dignity
of the priesthood, and, consequently, with some portion
of divinity. The same honours were conferred on
Freya, the sister of Freyr who taught the Asser the
magic which she had learned among her countrymen,
the Vanir.—At length, the victorious arms of the
Romans approached the kingdom of Asheim; and Odin,
learning from the fates that settlements were provided
for him in the north of Europe, left his two brothers
with the sovereignty of Asheim, and, attended by a
great multitude of followers, advanced into the west.
In his progress through Germany he placed his sons
over the states which his arms reduced. He then passed
northward, and fixed his seat at Odensey (Odin’s
Island). From thence he despatched Gefio, one of his
prophetesses, to make proselytes in the neighbouring
regions; and she was well received by both Gylfe,
king of Sweden, and by the Jutes. They did not, indeed,
embrace her religious faith; but they gave her
lands and revered her as one of the chief supports of
magic. In the sequel she married Skiold, the son of
Odin, who reigned over the Danish islands. Odin,
himself, advanced into Sweden, and forced Gylfe to
cede to him the eastern part of that kingdom. He
established his seat at Sigtuna, where he caused temples
to be erected and sacrifices to be offered. Thence his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>authority and his worship were diffused throughout
Germany and Scandinavia.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The qualities of this extraordinary man are the
favourite theme of the Swedish and Norwegian chroniclers.
He was the father, says Snorro, of all the
arts in northern Europe. He could change his looks
at pleasure. To his friends he was exceedingly
beautiful, and their hilarity he was always desirous to
promote. To his enemies, especially in battle, he
seemed a demon: the countenance which before was
so exquisitely attractive, now inspired terror and death.
Such was his eloquence that he captivated all who
heard him, and he always spoke in verse: hence he was
called the artificer of song; and from him northern
poetry had its origin. In imitation of him all the
magicians of Scandinavia couched their incantations in
metrical numbers: indeed, he had so warranted the
example, that the most potent runes would, in popular
opinion, have lost their efficiency had they been in
prose. By these verses Odin could, in the hour of
battle, strike his enemies with blindness, with deafness,
or with panic fear, and render their sharpest
weapons blunt as twigs. By the same means he could
render his own men as furious wolves, strong as
bears or bulls, and invulnerable to steel or fire. Often,
while his body lay supine, he would assume another
form,—that of fish, serpent, or wild beast,—and in
a moment hasten to the remotest parts. At his mere
command, fire ceased to burn, the wind to blow, and
the sea to rage; and the elements moved in what
direction he pleased. He had a wonderful ship, called
Skidbladner, which he could fold up like a handkerchief,
yet which carried him through the most dangerous
seas.—According to the latter Edda, this ship was
built by the dwarfs,—probably the Lapps, so called to
distinguish them from the Jutish giants,—who were
rather the allies than the enemies of the gods. Small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>as this vessel was,—since it could be easily carried in
a pocket or in the palm of the hand,—yet, when expanded,
“all the gods, completely armed, could sit in it.”
And it had another wonderful property: the moment
the sails were unfurled, a favourable wind was sure to
rise, and bear the passengers wherever they wished to go.
Then there was the embalmed head of Mimir, which acquainted
him with whatever he wished to know. And
he had two ravens which he endowed with the gift of
speech, and which, continually flying over the earth,
brought him intelligence of everything that happened.
Sometimes he summoned the dead from their
graves: hence he was called the Lord of the Tombs.
He was profoundly versed in the art called <i>seid</i>,—the
art which foretold events, which induced or removed
death, sickness, pain, and all the ills of mankind. He
knew all the treasures concealed in the bowels of the
earth, the incantations which could open them, the
laws which governed the fairy inhabitants of the mountains,
the stream, and the rock: their motions were
regulated by his mere word. Hence his wide-spread
fame; hence the confidence of his followers, and the
terror of his enemies. Many were the arts which he
taught his pontiffs, by which they were rendered nearly
as wise and powerful as himself. He and his twelve
pontiffs were worshipped as gods. The laws which he
introduced were those anciently adopted by the Asser.
He commanded the corpses of the dead to be consumed
on the funeral pile, and with them the most
valuable things of the deceased, affirming that whatever
was thus consumed would accompany the hero
to Valhalla, and still administer to his wants. The
ashes of men in general were to be cast into the
sea, or buried in the earth: only some of eminent dignity
or merit were to have tombs erected in their
honour. The first great sacrifice he ordered to be
solemnised on the approach of winter, as a thanksgiving
for the gifts of the year; the second, in mid-winter,
for another propitious season; the third, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>summer, for victory over all enemies. On every head
a tax was laid, and the produce was expended in the
defence of the kingdom, in the sustentation of the
temples, and in public sacrifices.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Whether Odin ever existed,—whether himself and
his alleged Asiatics are not mere creatures of the imagination,—whether
they are not purely mythologic, and
referrible to an Asiatic source, at a period lost in the
depths of antiquity, have long exercised the ingenuity
of writers. In matters of pure history it is certainly
better to err on the side of scepticism than of credulity;
but in the present instance we cannot discover sufficient
grounds for the former opinion. That he existed,
and at no distant period antecedent to the invasion of
England by the Saxons, is affirmed, alike, by written
testimony and tradition. According to that venerable
and most inestimable relic of antiquity, the “Saxon
Chronicle,” all the princes of the nation derived their
origin from the deified hero; and the number of generations
between him and the reigning king are
minutely recorded. Thus, from Odin to Cerdic, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
495, are ten generations; from Odin to Ida, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 547,
the same number; from Odin to Ella, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 560, twelve;
from Odin to Ceolwulf, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 597, thirteen; from Odin
to Penda, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 626, twelve; from Odin to Offa, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
755, sixteen; from Odin to Ethelwolf, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 854,
twenty-three generations. In all these lists the intervening
chain, from the wizard king to his Saxon descendant,
are carefully specified. In the same manner
the series of northern kings, from the sons of Odin, who
were placed by him over the thrones of Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, is progressively detailed. Thus, in
Denmark, the generations from Skiold, the son of Odin, to
Ragnar Lodbrok, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 794, are twenty-five. In Sweden,
from Niord (the <i>adopted</i> son, perhaps, of Odin) to Olaf,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 630, are twenty-three generations. In Norway, the
succession of kings from the same Niord, to Harald Harfager,
the first <i>monarch</i> of that country, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 934, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>twenty-eight. We think that these genealogical series, so
carefully, so minutely particularised, afford a presumption,
at least, that the pontiff king of the north both lived
and reigned at a period not very far distant from our
Saviour’s birth. Not that the subject is without its
difficulties. The events ascribed to Odin’s times have,
by many writers, been deemed inapplicable to any century
within the known history of the world. Hence,
some have removed him to the age immediately following
the flood; some, to the seventh century after that
event; some, to the age of Darius Hystaspes; others, to
that of Philip, king of Macedon; others, to less than
two centuries before Christ; while another party contends
that he was more recent still, and that Ariovistus,
whom Cæsar conquered, was one of his sons. Where
so much contradiction, so much absurdity abound, our
only guide, in the absence of positive evidence, is reason;
and this confirms the generally received opinion, that
this personage is of far less antiquity than was formerly
supposed. Not that many of his rites, many of his
notions, many, perhaps, of his alleged actions, are not
more ancient. There is, indeed, some reason to infer
that they were known in Asiatic Scythia, a thousand
years before his time. But this fate is not
peculiar to Odin; it has been that of all celebrated
men. Whoever has entered profoundly into the history
of tradition, must be aware that legends which were
formerly applicable to the most ancient characters, were
applied to comparatively modern ones, when the latter
had been dead long enough to permit the imagination
to invest them with new attributes. Thus, many which
have been related of Charlemagne’s heroes,—of Charlemagne
himself,—of the crusaders, especially of our
Cœur de Lion’s age, were once the glory of pagans,
and were derived from a northern or an oriental source,
before Normans, Franks, or Angles were known.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>So much for direct and positive evidence, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>strongly confirmed by inference. The Goths, like all
the Scythians, were accustomed to deify their deceased
heroes. This is expressly affirmed by several writers,
especially by Adam of Bremen; and heroes are mentioned,
who, we find, were deified. Thus, Armin, or
Ermin, the courageous supporter of Germanic independence
against the Romans, was worshipped as a
god; and his famous idol, which was called, after his
name, Irminsul, drew multitudes of pagans to the Isle
of Rugen: it was, indeed, regarded as the palladium
of Germanic liberty. The facility with which kings
and heroes were deified is still more strikingly illustrated
in the life of St. Anscar, the apostle of the Scandinavians.
Alarmed at the success which attended the
preaching of that admirable missionary (this was about
the middle of the ninth century), the priests of the
Odinian worship had recourse to a bold imposture. By
their contrivance a man suddenly appeared in the
Swedish capital, who affirmed that he had just attended
a general meeting of the gods, and that he was bearer
of a communication from them to king Olaf and his
people. The substance of it was, that the ancient
deities had always been most indulgent to the Swedes;
that, hitherto, they had found no reason to complain of
an ungrateful return from their worshippers; that now,
however, there was a sad decline in the sacrifices and
other proofs of devotion; and that their wrath was
especially excited by the introduction of a new deity,—of
one peculiarly hostile to the gods of the kingdom.
“If,” added they, “you Swedes really wish to increase
the number of gods, we will readily admit your departed
king, Eric, to the honours of deification.” That the
proposal was accepted—that a temple was immediately
erected to Eric—that his altars perpetually smoked
with sacrifices,—are among the most indubitable facts of
history. Hence, there is nothing unreasonable in the
deification of Odin; indeed, he could not have avoided
the honour. One so celebrated as he was,—a great
warrior, a great legislator, the founder of a new empire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and of a new religion,—assuredly could not fail to be
invested with the same honours as an Armin or an
Eric. Indeed, as it was the obvious policy of the
Asiatic followers of Odin to represent the authority of
their pontiff king and his successors as founded on
divine, not on human, sanction,—as that authority was
avowedly theocratic,—he must, of necessity, have been
regarded as a god, if not in his lifetime, immediately
after his decease.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The temporal no less than the spiritual government
of Odin, and the social superiority of his immediate followers
over the inhabitants he found in Sweden, drew our
attention in the early pages of this Introduction. Our
opinions on this subject are strongly confirmed by a judicious
living writer. “Odin founded the empire of the Sviar,
which was originally confined to a small territory around
the Mœlar Sea, in the present Swedish province of Upland,
called the lesser Svíthjód, in contrast to the greater
Svíthjód, or Scythia, whence they migrated, and Mannaheim,
or the Home of Man, in contrast to the celestial
abode of Asgard. By degrees the Sviar, as the leading
tribe governed by the pontiff kings, the immediate
descendants of Odin, and having the custody of the
great temple at Sigtun, the principal seat of the new
superstition, acquired an ascendancy over the Goths,
who possessed the more southern tract of country called
Gautland, Götland, or Göta-rike. This precedence of
the Sviar over the Goths is established by the express
terms of the ancient fundamental law of their joint
empire, according to which the ‘king was elected by
the national assembly of all the Swedes (<i>å Ting allra
Svia</i>), at the Mora-Stone, in the plain near Upsal, and
the assembly of all the Goths (<i>Ting allra Göta</i>), shall
re-elect or confirm him.’<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a> This distinction between
the two tribes is constantly preserved in the traditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and annals of the middle ages, and the division between
the Svia and Göta-rike is strongly marked by a chain of
mountains running between Södermanland and East
Gothland. It is also recognised at this day in the constitution
of the supreme judicial tribunals called the
Svea and Götha Hofrät, established during the reign of
Gustavus Adolphus, and to which a third has been recently
added for the provinces of Scania and Bleking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of the ancient documents which throws the
most light upon the history of the heroic age in the
north, is the most recently published of the Eddaic
poems, called <i>Rigs-mál</i>. The prince of that name is
said to have been the son of Skjold, and, according to
the chronology of Suhm, reigned in Scania about the
end of the second century of the Christian era.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a> This
poem contains a minute classification of the different
orders of society, personified as the children of king
Rig, who is supposed to have divided them into distinct
castes, assigning to each its respective rank in the social
scale. As a literary composition, it resembles the
Anglo-Saxon poem of Bjówulf, and all other genuine
traditionary poems or romances of uncivilised nations,
in its unpretending and Homeric simplicity of style and
incidents. In this respect it has been justly called one
of the most curious and interesting ‘manners-painting
strains’ that have been preserved and handed down to
posterity.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a> The effects of the original Gothic migration
and conquest in Scandinavia are here distinctly
marked in the features of the slave caste, descended
from the aboriginal Finns, and distinguished from their
conquerors by black hair and complexion, as well as the
squalid poverty and misery in which they were compelled
to live. The caste of freemen and freeholders,
lords of the soil which they cultivated, and descended
from the Gothic conquerors, with their reddish hair,
fair complexion, and all the traits which peculiarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>mark that famous race,—is in like manner personified
in a vivid description of a single family. Then comes
the caste of the illustrious Jarls and the Herser, earls
and barons, who are distinguished from the others by
their still fairer hair and skin, by their noble employments
and manners, from whom descend the kingly
race, skilled in Runic science, in manly exercises, and
the military art.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have, here, the early history of the Scandinavians
traced in a few lines; but these are strongly
marked, and confirmed by all the traditions of the
ancient north, respecting the different races of men by
which the country was successively occupied.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The
first Gothic emigrants subdued the Celto-Finnish tribes,
who were the primitive inhabitants of the country, and
reduced them to servitude, or drove them, first, to the
mountains, and then to the desert wilds and fastnesses
of Norrland, Lapland, and Finland. Here the Jötnar,
as they were called by their Gothic invaders, continued
to adhere to the grovelling superstition of their fathers,
which was that form of polytheism which has been
called Fetichism, or the adoration of beasts and birds,
of stocks and stones, all the animate and inanimate
works of creation. The antipathy between these two
races, so continually alluded to in the songs and sagas
of the mythic and heroic age, is significantly expressed
in the legend of Njördr, who dwelt by the sea-side, and
Skade, a mountain-nymph of the rival race of the
Jötnar, whom he had espoused. She very naturally
prefers her native abode on the Alpine heights, whilst
he insists on dwelling where he can hear the roar of the
ocean billows. At last, they compromise this matrimonial
dissension by agreeing to pass nine nights alternately
among the mountains, and three on the sea-shore.
But Njördr soon tires of this compact, and vents his
dissatisfaction in a lay to this effect:—‘How do I
hate the mountain wilds! I have only passed nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>nights there; but how long and tedious did they seem!
There one hears nothing but the howling of wolves,
instead of the sweet notes of the swan.’ To which
Skade extemporises this response:—‘How can I rest
on the sandy sea-shore, where my slumbers are every
morning broken by the hideous screaming of the sea-gulls?’
The result is, that she deserts her husband,
and returns to the mountains, where her father dwells:
there, snatching up her bow, and fastening on her
snow-skates, she bounds over the hills in pursuit of the
wild beasts.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“The Sviar, who migrated with the historic Odin,
achieved no forcible conquest over their national brethren
of the Gothic tribe, by whom they had been preceded.
The ascendancy of Odin and his followers over
their predecessors was acquired and maintained by
superstition, and their supposed superiority in magic
and the other arts which win the confidence or influence
the fears of a barbarous nation. The older worship of
the primitive inhabitants, and of their conquerors, was
modified by this new prophet, who, taking advantage of
the pre-existing belief in the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls, and the incarnation of divine spirits,
so widely diffused among the ancient people of the
earth, pretended to be the former Odin, who had again
descended among his faithful Goths.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> His worship thus
soon supplanted that of the more ancient Odin, and the
attributes and actions of both were gradually confounded
together in the apprehension of the Scandinavians. But
it did not supplant that of Thor, whom the primitive
people of the north regarded as the elder and most
beneficent of the deities. In him they worshipped the
goodly elements of nature,—the light, the heat, and especially
the thunder, shaking and purifying the atmosphere.
This deity was principally revered in Norway;
and, after its discovery and settlement, in Iceland: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>he maintained his recognised equality with the other
superior gods even in the great temple of Upsal, the
principal seat of the northern superstition. His votaries
formed a distinct sect, who were often engaged in
deadly strife with the peculiar worshippers of Odin.
The next deity in the Scandinavian hierarchy was
Freyer, who represented the prolific powers of Nature,
and, with his sister Freya, the Venus of this mythology,
was principally revered in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland;
whilst Odin and his son, Balder, were adored
both at Upsal and Ledra as the peculiar national deities
of the Gothic Danes and Sviar. The religion of the
north, as it was at last modified by this new dispensation,
in the conjoint adoration of Thor, Odin, and
Freyer, bore a strong family likeness to the three
principles of Schamanism, or the faith professed by the
votaries of the Dalai Lama in central Asia. This
correspondence points most significantly to its origin;
and the filiation of religious creeds and forms of
worship thus combines with that of language to trace
the present people of the north to the remotest regions
of the East.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The temporal government established by Odin was perpetuated
through his sons. Thus Heimdall was placed
over Scania, the original seat of the Danes. Semming had
Norway. From another son sprung the Ynglings, who
reigned for many centuries in Sweden and Norway.
Skiold, a fourth son, led a colony into Zealand, which
became the seat of a different kingdom; hence the Skioldungs,
or the regal family of Denmark. And as to Balder,
he was the king of the Angles, if any faith is to be placed
in the “Saxon Chronicle.” Thus, according to tradition,
as embodied in the Icelandic and Norwegian sagas, and in
other monuments of antiquity, Odin was the progenitor
of all the great dynasties of the north. But in regard
to some parts of Norway, we must not forget the family
of <i>Nor</i>,—the mythologic, or rather mythic, Nor, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>fame was so widely spread, and from whom the whole
country derived its name. Doubtless the native chiefs,
those who descended from ancestors long antecedent to
Odin’s arrival, were proud enough of their descent, and
too much attached to their ancient religion—more
ancient than Odin’s—to care for either the Asiatic
conqueror or his attendant drottnar. But the kings
of the Asser, or divine race, whose chief deity was
this very Odin, boasted of a spiritual pre-eminence,
superior, by far, to their temporal.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But, reverting to the narrative of Saxo, and the
alleged succession of the Danish kings, Hoder, whom
(as we have before observed) Gewar, a king in Norway,
had educated, won the heart of Nanna, the daughter of
his benefactor. She had, however, the misfortune to
influence a divine lover, Balder, the son of Odin, who,
like David, had seen her in the bath. As he knew of
her attachment to Hoder, he resolved to remove that
person by violence; but the latter had friends powerful
as those of his enemy. One day, while hunting in the
mountains, Hoder entered a cloud, and suddenly beheld
a number of virgins, who, though bearing some resemblance
to the maids of Norway, were in reality the fatal
sisters. They accosted him by name, told him that his
beloved Nanna had smitten the heart of Balder, but
warned him not to attempt the life of the demi-god.
They informed him that they were present, unseen, in
all battles—that they were the arbiters of good and
evil—and that they often assisted their mortal friends
when assistance was most required. Saying this, they
disappeared so quickly, that his eye could not follow
them. On his return, he related to Gewar what he had
seen, and besought the hand of Nanna. The old king
had no objection to the match; but he dreaded the
wrath of Balder, on whose charmed body mortal weapon
could have no effect. He added, however,—for he was
a great magician,—that there was a sword kept by
Mimring, a satyr of the woods, with virtue enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>slay the demi-god. The same being had bracelets, of
efficacy so wonderful, as greatly to increase the bodily
strength of the possessor. But how obtain these miraculous
gifts? The abode of the satyr was amidst
rocks and snows, and almost inaccessible to man.
Hoder was, however, to take his sledge and rein-deer;
to reach the alpine solitudes; to pitch his tent, so that
the shadow of the satyr’s grove might fall upon it; and
to watch day and night, with untiring patience, for the
appearance of the mysterious occupant. The prince
did as he was commanded; he fasted and watched, until
one night, feigning to be asleep, he perceived the satyr
attentively observing his tent. In a moment, he struck
the monster, bound it with fetters, and threatened to
kill it if it did not surrender the sword and bracelets.
His life was dearer than those treasures. Hoder gained
his object, and returned in triumph to the court of
Gewar. The value of the treasure, indeed, was too
great not to raise up rivals for its possession; and one
king (Gelder, who has left his name to a well-known
Dutch province), sailed with a powerful armament
against him; but if it excited envy, it also aided its
owner, and Hoder was victorious.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In the mean time, Balder, terrible in arms, entered
the dominions to obtain the fair Nanna by force, should
entreaties be ineffectual. But she was deaf to the most
honied flattery. Without betraying her attachment for
Hoder, which would only place him in greater jeopardy,
she represented in strong colours the inequality
of the proposed marriage. “The chain which bound
a god to a mortal,” she observed, “could not be a
lasting chain. When the fervour of passion had subsided,
the superior being, despising his ill-assorted
choice, would at once dissolve it.” Balder had recourse
to arms; and he was joined by the army of the gods,
at the head of which were Odin and Thor. Here were
fearful odds; but Hoder was not discouraged. His
magic bracelets rendered him impenetrable to steel; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>though the hammer of Thor crushed everything on
which it fell, he had the courage to meet the Scandinavian
thunderer. With his wonderful sword he cut
off the handle of the all-destructive weapon, so as to
render it useless; and the gods, deprived of their great
support, took refuge in flight. The victory was complete;
the allies of the gods were destroyed; their
bodies cast by the waves on the shores; and the victor
performed the last rites to their manes. “Strange,”
concludes Saxo, “that gods could be thus routed by
mortals!” But he accounts for the circumstance by
gravely observing that they were deities in human
estimation only, and not in reality. He evidently regards
them merely as magicians and priests; wise,
indeed, far beyond human wisdom, but still mortal.
His religion, his profession, compelled him thus to
regard them; and often, when he employs the term
god, he adds the saving clause which we have just
noticed.—To proceed: as the reward of this victory,
Hoder obtained the hand of Nanna, with the throne of
one part of Sweden; but he was shortly afterwards
vanquished by Balder, and he lost the crown of Denmark.
He and Balder were dreadful rivals. Through
his love for Nanna, the latter wasted gradually away.
To procure a greater share of the divine favour, he
offered human sacrifices to Fro, and the fatal precedent
was but too well imitated by succeeding ages. In the
next battle, he was again the victor, and his rival compelled
to seek an asylum in an obscure village of Jutland.
Here, unattended and discouraged, Hoder felt the
more deeply the contrast of situations. From Jutland,
he passed into Sweden, privately assembled his staunch
adherents, and represented to them the hopelessness of
his prospects—that he was alike weary of empire and
life. Compelled, indeed, to consult his safety by wandering
from forest to forest, from one cavern to another,
he exhibited a remarkable example of the instability of
fortune, in a region where such vicissitudes were more
frequent than in any other part of the world. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>emergency, while sojourning amidst woods never trod
by man, he one day entered a cave, in which he found
the weird sisters. Being asked what had brought him
to their solitudes, he replied, “Misfortune in war.”
He bewailed his hard fate, and asserted that their
predictions had not been verified, but had been contradicted
by the event. They contended, however, that if
he had been twice put to flight, he had inflicted as
great an injury on the enemy as the enemy had inflicted
on him. But Balder was on the throne of Denmark;
what consolation, therefore, could he receive? He was,
indeed, told, that if he could only discover and appropriate
to himself a certain species of food, which was
every day served to his rival, and which increased that
rival’s strength in a prodigious manner, he should
become the victor. How discover it? But, whatever
his fate, it could not be more disastrous than the
present; and he again sought Balder in arms. The
first day’s fight was indecisive. At night, he lay in his
tent; but sleep refusing to visit him, he arose and went
towards the enemy’s camp. There he saw three virgins
(the purveyors of Balder’s table) leave that prince’s
tent. He accosted them; and being asked who he was,
replied, “A harper,”—a character always sacred in the
north. As he was really expert in the use of the instrument,
he was readily believed, and he was allowed
to see what the mysterious substance was which had
such miraculous effect on the body of his rival: it was
the venom of three snakes which the virgins daily or
nightly extracted from the mouths of the reptiles, and
which they mixed with the more solid food of Balder.
One of the maidens wished to give some of the food to
Hoder, but the eldest forbade her. All, however, were
so pleased with his minstrelsy, that they presented him
with a belt, which would ensure him the victory over
all his enemies. The prophecy was soon fulfilled. Possessed
of this belt, in addition to his other magical
treasures, he met his enemy and gave him a mortal
wound. Like a true northern hero, Balder being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>resolved to die on the field of battle, was carried in a
litter into the heart of Hoder’s army; but he soon
breathed his last sigh. Over his body a huge mound
was erected by his troops. That treasures of inestimable
value were buried with him, was the unanimous
opinion of posterity. In the time of Saxo, some youths
one night hastened to the spot, and endeavoured to
open it; but their ears being assailed by terrific noises,
they desisted, and fled. All this, says the historian,
was unreal; it was merely the illusion of magic.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Respecting the death and interment of Balder, we
have in the latter Edda many details wholly omitted by
Saxo, and more which are entirely dissimilar from his.
One night, this Balder had a dream, which was thought
to be portentous of his fate. With the consent of the gods
his mother, Freya or Frigga, called on fire, water, earth,
stones, iron and other metals, trees, animals, birds, reptiles,
poison, and all diseases, to renounce all power over
him; and they took an oath to that effect. To try the efficacy
of the engagement, some of the gods threw darts and
stones at him, while some assailed him with other weapons:
in vain; no one could injure him. Seeing this,
Loke, the genius of evil, assumed the disguise of an old
woman, went to the palace of Frigga, and informed her
what the gods were doing. “Let them try as long as
they please,” was the reply; “all living things have promised
to respect my son.” “What!” rejoined Loke,
whose purpose is evident enough, “have all substances,
without exception, thus promised?” “All,” was the
reply, “except one insignificant plant, called mistletoe,
which grows on the western side of Valhalla, and from
which, such is its feebleness, I exacted no oath.” This
was enough for Loke: he went to the place where the
mistletoe grew, plucked it up by the roots, and returned
to the assembly of the gods, who were still occupied
in the same diversion. According to this account,
Hoder was present; but he was not a deity, he
was merely a blind old man. “Why dost thou not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>join in the exercise?” demanded Loke. “Because I
am blind.” “Take this trifling reed, and throw it; I
will guide thine hand; meet it is for us all to honour
Balder!” The missile flew, and the hero fell to rise
no more. The gods were in sad consternation at this
event; the more so as the evil was irreparable. All
that the afflicted father could now do was, to pay due
honours to his remains. His body was borne to the
sea coast; it was placed in the famous ship of the
deceased, which was one of the largest in the world;
but neither Odin nor all the gods assembled could
move the vessel into the waters. In this emergency,
they had recourse to a famous sorceress of the giant,
namely, of the Jutish race, and she obeyed the call. She
arrived on the back of a wild beast, having serpents for
reins. So dreadful was this animal, that it required
four giants to hold it after she had dismounted. At
one push, Gyges sent the ship into the sea; and so
great was its velocity, that the earth trembled. The
funeral pile was then erected by command of Odin, and
the body of Balder’s wife, whom grief brought to the
grave, laid on it, close by his. Who was she?
The Edda expressly calls her Nanna, but assigns her
another father than Gewar. There can, however, be
no doubt that the beautiful confusion so prevalent in
everything connected with Scandinavian characters and
events, is doubly apparent in this case,—that the wife of
Hoder and Balder is one and the same Nanna, however
the tradition in regard to her may have been distorted.
Yet, there is no greater confusion respecting this lady
than there is respecting Hoder himself in the different
relations of Saxo and Snorro, the compiler of the prose
Edda. In the one case, as we have seen, he was a
vigorous young prince; in the other, a blind, feeble,
and apparently old one. This diversity of narrative
arises from the diversity of sources consulted by the
two historians—the one confining himself to the
national songs of Denmark, the other consulting the
old Norwegian, or rather Icelandic traditions, which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Scalds had transmitted to posterity. During the middle
ages, especially anterior to the fourteenth century, there
was a vast body of legendary lore respecting Odin, his
family, and his sacerdotal companions—lore from
which different Scalds took what they judged most interesting
to their hearers. But reverting to the funeral of
Balder, Thor furnished the consecrated fire: the horse
of the deceased hero was placed on the pyre; and Odin
added his golden ring, which had the miraculous virtue
of producing eight other rings every ninth night.
Thus, in the presence of all the gods, satyrs, nymphs,
and cyclops, was the conflagration effected.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>According to the same venerable authority, namely,
the Edda of Snorro, an attempt was made to recover
the soul of Balder from the empire of Hela, or death.
Who would undertake the perilous mission? It was
Hermod, another son of Odin, that, at the entreaty of
his mother, saddled Sleipner, the famous black steed,
mounted him, and plunged into the subterraneous
paths which led to the abodes of the dead. This
Sleipner has a reputation never before enjoyed by
quadruped. During the frequent contests between the
gods and the giants—that is, between the Goths and
the Jutes—the former were not always victorious;
nor were they always sure of impunity within their
fortress, well guarded as it was. One day an architect
appeared before them and proposed to build them such
a city that all the power of Jotunheim should fail
against it. For this service, however, he must have his
reward; and a splendid one it was, the goddess Freya
to wife, with the sun and moon as her dowry. They
agreed to his terms, provided he did what no doubt
they believed impossible, viz., execute the work himself,
within the space of a single winter; and they were
liberal enough to allow him the use of his horse. In a
short time the gods had reason to be alarmed; for the
horse not only drew stones of vast magnitude, but did
more of the architectural work than the master. Within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>three days of the completion of winter nothing remained
but the hanging of the gates. In great consternation
the gods assembled to consult by what means
the ruin impending might be averted. As the covenant
between them and the architect had been advised by
Loke, they menaced him with death unless he discovered
some expedient to save them. Loke, who has
sometimes been called the Scandinavian devil, was fond
of mischief; but he was fonder still of his life: and
that very night he caused a mare to issue from a forest
and neigh amorously. Sleipner, hearing the sound, left
the work to pursue the mare, while the architect followed
to recover his horse. Thus the whole night was
lost. The architect now perceived that he must trust
to himself. He resumed his natural size, and there he
stood, a veritable giant—the everlasting enemy of the
gods! They did not allow him to finish the work; but,
regardless of their oaths, which in their opinion were
not binding when made to a giant, they called on Thor
to dash out his brains with the awful mallet. In the
mean time the mysterious horse remained with the
mare, and the issue of the connection was Sleipner with
eight feet,—the most excellent of all the animals ever
possessed by gods or men.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the animal on which Hermod descended
to the regions of Hela. The description of his journey
is highly poetical. During nine days and as many
nights, he travelled down the precipitous way—often
abrupt—along the sides of yawning gulfs—through
rugged valleys; and everything was involved
in so great a darkness that he was obliged to grope, or
trust to the instinct of his wondrous beast. At length
he reached a river, the bridge of which was kept by a
virgin called Modguder. She inquired his name, his
race, his family; and expressed her surprise at his
weight. “But yesterday,” she observed, “and three
legions of dead rode over this bridge; yet all together
did not shake it as much as thou alone. But thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>hast not the look of one dead. What brings thee here?”
He replied, “I am in search of my brother Balder;
hast thou seen him pass?”—“I have: he rode over
the bridge: the path to Hecate’s dark abode is still
downwards, towards the north!” On he rode until
he came to the gates of hell, which were closed to all
but the dead. But he was not discouraged; plunging
his spurs into his wondrous horse, he cleared the gate,
and proceeded into a hall of vast extent. Here he
perceived his brother, who filled the most honourable
place. But far less honourable was it than the meanest
in Valhalla, which Balder could not enter because it
had not been his good fortune to die in battle. It is,
however, some consolation for us, poor mortals, to perceive
that hospitality is not forgotten in the gloomy
regions below. Hermod remained the whole night;
and the next morning he acquainted Hela with the
anxiety of the gods, of men, of all nature, for the
return of Balder, and besought her to permit it. She
seemed to doubt whether the mourning for the hero
was so universal as he had represented; but, to place
the matter beyond dispute, she replied, that if all objects,
inanimate no less than animate, would weep for
him, the request of the gods should be granted. Hermod
accordingly rose to depart. By Nanna he was intrusted
with several presents for Frigga, his mother:
from Balder he was the bearer of a ring (no doubt the
one which had been placed in the funeral pile!) to
their father Odin. He was then escorted to the outer
gate as if he had been a favoured guest just leaving the
palace of an earthly sovereign. On reaching Asgard,
where Odin then was, he acquainted the gods with the
message of Hela. By their advice agents were sent
through all creation, praying everything to weep
for Balder. By everything was the mandate obeyed,
except by one old sorceress, who refused to weep, and
said that Hela must keep her prey.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>But in the elder or poetical Edda—that of Sæmund
the Wise, which in compilation is antecedent a full
century to Snorro’s—the journey to the shades is
attributed to Odin himself. When it was undertaken,
Balder was yet alive, but dreams and portents
afflicted him; and, after consulting the fates,
Odin mounted his steed, Sleipner, and descended in
darkness towards the abode of Hela, where a celebrated
prophetess had been long interred. He met the terrible
dog which the Greeks preserved in their mythology,
and which, with bloody jaws, barked loudly as he passed
along. Downwards he went, the earth trembling beneath
his steed, until he reached the lofty hall of Hela.
From the eastern gate he proceeded to the spot where
he knew the tomb of the prophetess was to be found.
Turning himself towards the north, he then commenced
the fatal incantation, and placed in order the
mystic rhymes. Many were the words of might which
he uttered, until he forced the unwilling prophetess
to raise her head, and to speak in the language of men.
“What unknown mortal is he who has thus disturbed
my repose? Bleached by the snow, beaten by the
winds, drenched by the rains, have I long remained,—long
here I have been in the arms of death!”—“Vegtam
is my name, the son of Valtam.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Tell me the secrets
of hell, and I will tell thee what passes on earth. For
whom are these costly benches, for whom these golden
couches prepared?”—“This tempered mead, this liquid
nectar awaits the arrival of Balder. Sorrowful are the
sons of heaven. Unwillingly have I spoken; now my
lips shall be closed.”—“Listen, prophetess, for I must
know the whole. Whose hand shall deprive Odin’s son
of life?”—“That of Hoder: he the bruiser shall be
of Odin’s son, the spoiler of Balder’s life! Unwillingly
have I spoken; now my lips shall be closed.”—“Listen,
prophetess, for I must know the whole.
Who shall revenge on Hoder the death of the hero?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>who shall bear the smiter of Balder to the funeral
pyre?”—“Rinda, a virgin of the west, shall bear a
son by Odin; he, when only one night old, shall slay
the murderer. His hands he shall not wash, nor his
head shall he comb, until he bears to the funeral pyre
the enemy of Balder. Unwillingly have I spoken;
now my lips shall be closed.”—“Listen, prophetess,
for I must know the whole. Who are these damsels that
weep at pleasure and raise their covered heads on high?<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
Say this only, and thou mayest sleep.”—“Ah! no
wandering spoiler art thou, as I have hitherto believed:
well do I know thee for Odin, the preserver of nations!”—“And
thou art not Vala; no prophetess
art thou; but the mother of the three infernal furies!”—“Odin,
ride back to thine house, and there
command! Never again will I be consulted by the
living until Loke shall break loose from his fetters, and
the dreaded twilight of the gods arrive!”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Such is
the dark poetical legend which the genius of our poet<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Gray has immortalised. It is among the most imaginative
efforts of the Scandinavian muse.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>According to Saxo, it was not the mystic Vala, but
Rostiof, king of the Finns, who foretold that Odin’s
son, by Rinda, should avenge the death of Balder.
That Odin, who was esteemed chief of the gods, should
be less prescient than a Finnish king, may appear
strange; but this term <i>god</i> frequently means no more
than Goth, and the chief of the gods means only the
head of the pontifical college established, first in Asia,
and next in Sweden. And we must remember that
the Finns were expressly declared to be unrivalled in
magic, at least in that dark magic which sought the
injury of mankind. Yet Odin was equally malignant.
He could not rest until he had discovered the maiden
whose offspring was thus predestined to accomplish
his purpose. This Rinda was a princess, and, consequently,
demanded more attention than one of
humbler birth. The disguises which he successively
assumed at her father’s court; his frequent repulses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>by her; his numerous stratagems, and his ultimate
triumph under the character of a physician; are
gravely related by the venerable historian of Denmark.
His conduct on these occasions was so unworthy
of a god, that his colleagues at Byzantium
(or we should rather suppose Asgard) removed him
for a time from their society, deprived him of his
supernatural powers, degraded him to the level of
mortals, and sentenced him to exile,—a doom which he,
therefore, suffered a second time, though on the former
occasion it had been self-imposed.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a> All this, in plain
English, means that he was expelled from the college
of priests. This natural explanation is confirmed by
the statement, that in ten years, the gods, pitying his
sufferings, or, perhaps, bribed by flattery and costly
gifts, restored him to all his former privileges. Lest
the public worship should sustain any injury, his place
had been supplied by one Oller, a priest so expert in
magic that he could cross the seas on a bone; but this
usurper was slain by the Swedes, just as Mitothin had
been slain. In the mean time Bo, the issue of Odin’s
connection with Rinda, grew up, and was intrusted by
the father with the sacred task of revenge. Accordingly
he advanced against the Danish king. Hoder
foresaw his doom; and, in an assembly of chiefs, he
prevailed on them to elect his son, Runi, for his successor.
In the battle which followed destiny was fulfilled:
he fell by the hand of Bo; but the victor also
received a mortal wound and died the following day.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>All that we have farther to say respecting Odin, in
the present Introduction, may be despatched in a few
words. Perceiving his end approach, he marked his
body with a sword, probably to denote the advantage of
dying by that weapon; and declared that he was going
to Godheim or paradise, where he should joyfully receive
his people. The Swedes were persuaded that he
was returned to Asgard to enjoy eternal life; and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>this belief his worship was renewed and enlarged. In
time of war, and before great battles, he often appeared
to them, promising victory to some, inviting
others to his hall,—in both respects the harbinger of
good. After death he was placed on the funeral pyre,
and burnt with exceeding pomp. His followers believed
the higher the smoke ascended the higher would
be his place among the gods; and that the more abundant
the riches consumed with him the richer he would
be in the other world.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From the concurrent testimony of Snorro, Saxo
Grammaticus, and the two Eddas, little doubt can be
entertained in regard to the true character of Odin.
He was evidently a conqueror, a king, a priest, a
lawgiver, and an adept in the superstitious practices of
his age. Endued with commanding talents and an unmeasured
ambition, he was enabled to take advantage
of circumstances in a degree seldom attained by mortals.
Perceiving the success which attended his views, and
the veneration in which his wisdom was held, he did
not hesitate to ascribe both to the peculiar favour of
the gods, from whom, like most of the Scythian princes,
he boasted of his descent. As he was of divine race,
why should he not participate in the privileges of divinity?
Short, indeed, is the transition from veneration
to actual worship; and there can be little doubt
that, even in his lifetime, this artful pontiff king had
altars smoking in his honour. But it is worthy of
remark that he was often regarded as a mortal, not
merely in his own age, but in subsequent ages; that
the words giants and gods are to be understood of
the Jutes and Goths,—the former, the original possessors
of the soil, the latter, the victorious strangers
from Asia—the dominant caste which arrogated to
itself the sacerdotal and regal functions, and thus preserved
its empire over the barbarous, enslaved population.
It was some time after his death before his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>worship was general in the north; and never would it
have been general had he not been esteemed the god of
war, the deity above all others dear to the ferocious
Northmen. Even as it is, he did not hold the highest
rank in the worship of all the Scandinavian nations.
The Norwegians held him inferior to Thor. Still he
is by far the most remarkable person that ever took advantage
of human credulity. Over a considerable portion
of Europe his worship was extended; and it was
not a transitory worship; for it prevailed, in Germany,
far into the ninth century; in Denmark and Sweden, a
century later; and in some parts of Norway it was not
extinct in the twelfth. Of the religion, however,
which he founded, or which he incorporated with the
superstition already subsisting on his arrival in the
north, we shall speak in a future chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the death of Hoder, the sceptre of Denmark, or
rather of a portion of Denmark, passed into the hands
of his son <i>Ruric</i>. The name of this prince is interesting
to an Englishman, from the fact that the alleged
events on which the tragedy of <i>Hamlet</i> is founded
happened in his reign. According to Saxo, Hamlet
was not the son of a Danish king. His father was
Horwendil, governor of Jutland, a famous pirate and
vassal of Ruric; but the authority was not undivided:
it was shared by Fengo, brother of Horwendil. Fengo
did nothing to merit the favour of Ruric; but Horwendil
was so valiant and able, that he was honoured
with the hand of Gertrude, daughter of the Danish king.
From this marriage sprung Hamlet, whose history is so
famous in the traditions of Denmark. Fengo could not,
without envy, behold the good fortune of his brother:
envy led to hatred, and hatred to fratricide. After
this deed he married the widowed Gertrude, and
succeeded to the whole government of Jutland. Hamlet
was no inattentive observer of these events. As a
pagan, his first duty was to revenge his father’s death:
a duty, to the force of which his uncle was fully alive,
and watchful to frustrate it. Spies being set on all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>actions, he feigned madness; he painted his face, put
on a strange garb, and uttered the most ridiculous
things. Frequently was he to be seen on the hearth,
seated among the ashes, and making wooden hooks,
which he hardened by the heat. His madness, however,
had method in it; and some of his replies,
ridiculous as they seemed, made the experienced doubt
whether he should be classed among the wisest or
the most foolish of mankind. “For what purpose
are these hooks?” was one day demanded of him.
“For the revenge of my father!” was the answer. As
nobody could see how they could effect that purpose,
he was ridiculed by all but the discerning, who supposed
that beneath this ostentatious display of insanity,
a profound object was concealed. Among
these, was jarl Fengo, who, wishing to prove whether
the suspicions were well or ill-founded, had recourse to
an expedient. The disposition of the prince was exceedingly
amatory; and it was thought that, if a young
handsome female were sent to him, he would betray
himself. The meeting was to be effected in a wood,
and spies were to be placed near him. On the day
appointed, he was commanded to ride into a forest.
As usual, he mounted with his face to the tail, which
he held in lieu of a bridle. There he found the
woman; and would have immediately betrayed himself,
had not his foster-brother obscurely hinted that he
should beware. The way in which this intimation was
communicated, like many other parts of Saxo’s narrative,
is too gross for translation. Enough to know,
that Hamlet was made to understand the danger of his
situation. Among his virtues, chastity was not to be
reckoned; and though the instances of its violation
cannot be recorded in these times, we may observe that,
even on the occasion before us, he indulged his propensity,
and was cunning enough to conceal it. Fengo,
therefore, was disappointed; but by the advice of a
friend, he had recourse to another expedient. Under
the pretext of a long absence on affairs of moment, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>left the palace, and provided that Hamlet should be
brought into the mother’s presence, while a spy, unknown
to both, should be near them, to hear every
word that he should utter. If he had any reason left,
it was not doubted he would be communicative with
one whom he loved, and who he knew would never
betray him. At the time appointed, the courtier
hastened to the apartment, where mother and son were
to meet, and hid himself under a heap of straw that
accidentally lay there—a curious illustration of domestic
economy in that age. Immediately afterwards, Hamlet
and Gertrude arrived; but the former was too much
aware of the dangers which involved him to indulge in
rational conversation with his mother, until he had
examined the locality. Imitating the crowing of a
cock—an imitation in which he was singularly
successful—and waving his arms as if they were
wings, he leaped on the straw, and was immediately
sensible that something lay beneath. With his sword
he despatched the intruder. After this act, while his
mother was bewailing his supposed insanity, he fiercely
upbraided her for her incestuous marriage with the
murderer of her first husband. This double crime he
did not assail exactly in the manner represented in the
drama, but in one more conformable with the barbarism
of the age, that is, in one of exceeding coarseness.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
His remonstrances are said to have kindled the sparks
of virtue in her heart; but the sequel ill corresponded
with this moral intention, or with the refined character
which the dramatist has given him. The man whom
he had killed he cut in pieces, boiled the members,
and threw them into the sewer to be eaten by the
swine. When Fengo returned, great was his surprise
to find that his courtier had disappeared—that not the
slightest trace of him could be discovered. One day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Hamlet, who was regarded as no more than a motley
fool, and to whom questions were put for amusement
only, being asked what had become of his uncle’s friend,
replied, “He fell into the common sewer, and being
unable to extricate himself, was found, and eaten by
the swine!” His reply furnished some amusement
to the hearers, who regarded it as a good motley invention.
They did not know that on all occasions, whether
grave or trivial, Hamlet spoke the truth.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But if the multitude were thus deluded, Fengo was
not. For his own safety he felt that the youth must
be removed; but to effect this some management was
required. He would not exasperate his wife, still less
the sovereign of Denmark, by openly executing the
prince. The deed must be secret, and done by other
than native hands, namely, by those of the English
king, who, we are gravely assured, was a tributary of
Denmark. Before Hamlet’s departure, he privately
desired his mother, in one year from that time, to celebrate
his funeral obsequies; assuring her, however, that
he would in one year return. Two creatures of Fengo
were his companions. One night, while they were buried
in sleep, he examined their baggage, and found, carved
on wood, the mandate to the English king. With his
usual cunning, he erased a portion of the characters;
and so altered the rest, that the foreign king was to put
his two companions to death, but to show every possible
kindness towards <i>himself</i>, and even to give him the
hand of an English princess. On their arrival in
England, they presented their wooden mandate, which
they were unable to read; and were invited, with much
parade of hospitality, to the royal table. But while
the two messengers were thus deluded, Hamlet was
received with much respect. The more curious reader
may consult the venerable authority before us for an
account of what passed at the English court,—an
account as minute as it is romantic. To be brief: the
two messengers were executed; and Hamlet, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>wisdom was so much admired, obtained the hand of the
monarch’s daughter. He pretended, however, to be
much affected by the death of his companions; and to
pacify him, the king gave him a considerable quantity
of gold, which he melted and inclosed in the hollow of
two walking sticks. At the expiration of the year, he
obtained leave to revisit his native country; but, of all
his riches, he took only the staves which contained the
gold. On reaching Jutland, he assumed his own
motley garb, and reached the house of his uncle at the
very time his funeral rites were performed. At first,
his sudden appearance terrified the domestics and guests;
but terror yielded to mirth when they saw him resume
his motley character. “Where are your two companions?”
demanded they. “Here they are!” was
his reply, as he produced his two sticks. Soon he
joined the cup-bearers; and as his long flowing garments
interfered with his activity, he girt his sword
round him, but it had no scabbard; and to impress all
the guests with a stronger notion of his insanity, he
frequently grasped the blade until the blood flowed
from his fingers. Little did they suspect his object in
thus descending to the meanest occupation: it was to
make all of them beastly drunk, and then to exact his
revenge. So well did he succeed in the first intention,
that most of them, being unable to stagger from the
apartment, were compelled to remain all night in the
hall of entertainment. At length, all being buried in
sleep, he cut off the cords which supported a huge
curtain that occupied the whole room: as it fell on the
drunken sleepers, by his wooden hooks he fastened it in
many places to the ground; and drawing the cords
over the curtain, so bound them by knots and hooks
as to bid defiance to the efforts of drunken men.
Startled by the weight no less than by the sudden
difficulty of breathing, they strove to raise the curtain,
but in vain; it was too well secured to be moved. In
this state they were soon enveloped in flames, which
consumed them and the palace. Fengo retired to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>bedroom, and fell asleep: he was awakened by Hamlet,
who, after upbraiding him for his various crimes, put
him to death. He then flew to a safe retreat to watch
the progress of events. Great was the surprise of the
Jutes at this disaster; but, as Fengo was a tyrant, the
majority were not displeased. Hamlet, therefore, reappeared;
surrounded himself with those whom he
knew to be attached to the interests of his family;
sought the public assembly; and, by his eloquence, so
wrought on the people, that they unanimously declared
him the successor of Fengo.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Into the remaining adventures of Hamlet—all
equally wonderful with the preceding—we cannot
enter. Whoever may wish to read his subsequent visit
to Britain; his marriage with a second wife, the queen
of Scotland; his quarrel with the British king, the
father of his first wife; his domestic life with both in
his hereditary government of Jutland; his war with
Wiglet, king of Denmark, the successor of his grandfather,
Ruric; his death in battle; and the facility
with which the idol of his heart, his second wife,
passed into the arms of the victor, must consult the
venerable Saxo.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We have no wish to pursue farther the list of
Danish kings, who, according to Saxo, reigned prior
to our Saviour’s birth. Some of them, probably, never
reigned at all. Others, certainly, reigned <i>after</i> that
event. Others, again, ruled at the same time, over
different provinces of the kingdom. The reigns of
many whom Saxo places before the Christian era are
identical with those which the best Danish writers
regard as posterior; and the actions attributed to both
are substantially the same. All writers admit that Denmark
had no monarch before Skiold, the son of Odin;
indeed, it had none for some generations afterwards:
for there is room to believe that even his authority was
more of a sacerdotal than of a temporal character. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>virtue of this character he might, and probably did,
claim a twofold sovereignty over the peninsula and
islands; but that sovereignty was never virtually exercised—it
was one merely nominal. Several of the
islands had their separate governors, whom Saxo calls
kings; and Jutland, as we have seen in the sketch of
Hamlet’s life, had them also. The men whom personal
qualities elevated above the rest, became chiefs;
and when one chief had others subject to him, he
assumed the regal title. There were kings of various
kinds. We read of petty kings (sma-konungur, or
fylke-konungur); of sea kings, island kings, and cape
kings. The name of the last may require an explanation.
They were neither more nor less than the
pirate chiefs, who lived in caverns or in huts near the
promontories, ready, at any moment, to sally forth and
seize the unsuspecting mariner. Thus there were kings
enough scattered over the seas, the forests, the mountains,
the maritime coasts of the north. Probably all
those in the Danish islands might yield a nominal
homage, at least, to the one that reigned in Scania in
Zealand. But no dependence whatever can be placed on
the list of Danish kings prior to what we now call the
historic times; that is, to about the eighth century of our
era. It is astonishing to see how little judgment has
been exercised by the historians of this country in
regard to the old northern kings. Thus, the authors of
the “Universal History,” not satisfied with giving the
names of the sovereigns from Dan to Frode III., have
been so far misled by the Latin historians of Denmark,
as to fix the precise year before Christ when each began
his reign.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>But later writers have made sad work with this list.
They contend that some of the names are altogether
fabulous; that Skiold reigned only forty years before
Christ; Frode I., thirty-five years after Christ; Wermund,
one hundred and fifty; Roe and Helge, in the
fifth century of our era. The truth, however, is, that
while no dependence is to be placed on the genealogical
series of the former, very little is due to the latter.
The whole, prior to the eighth century, is one mass
of confusion. If the names of many princes are to
be found, not merely in the earliest writers of the
north, but on Runic inscriptions, no power of criticism
can fix the period in which they reigned. All is pure
conjecture; and one system is preferable to another,
only so far as it is more reconcilable to common sense.
Yet, while we thus reject some of the ancient sovereigns
whom Saxo and the elder chroniclers have handed down
to us, we are not so sceptical as to reject the majority.
If, prior to Odin’s arrival, the north had no monarchs,
it had kings, or, if the reader pleases, chiefs, whose office
was sometimes hereditary, sometimes elective. It would,
perhaps, be more accurate to say that, while they succeeded
by hereditary right to the domains of their predecessors,
as <i>generals</i> and <i>judges</i>, they were elected by
the free-born warriors. Of these some were, beyond
all doubt, elevated into monarchs by tradition; from
tradition they passed into the songs of the Scalds; and
from these songs their memory was perpetuated by the
old chroniclers. For this reason we have not consigned
them to total oblivion. Nothing is more easy than
scepticism; but if scepticism be, as it assuredly is,
allowable in regard to many details, it is no less blameable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>than credulity, when it rejects the whole substance
of history. On the whole, the safest conclusion is,
that, while some of Saxo’s kings are imaginary—while
many which he places before, doubtless reigned after,
our Saviour—while he has confounded the whole order
of succession, so as hopelessly to perplex the reader—a
few, probably, lived and reigned before the establishment
of the Gothic dynasty.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>If</span>, in regard to the kings who reigned prior to the
Christian era, we have witnessed so much confusion, we
shall not witness less in the series which followed that
event. No two chroniclers, unless the one be immediately
derived from the other, agree in this respect.
Strange to say, this discrepancy as to names and dates
is observable in regard to comparatively recent kings;
to those, for instance, of the eighth and ninth centuries,—Snorro,
Saxo, Sweyn, Aggesen, Torfœus, Suhm,—all
differ, not only as to the order of succession, but as
to the names themselves.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Whence this difference?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Doubtless from a variety of causes. In the first place,
the title of Rex Danorum, or king of the Danes, was
applied to the governors of Jutland, no less than to those
whose seat was in Zealand and Scania. As either became
the more powerful, he claimed a place among the descendants,
or, at least, the successors, of Skiold. In the
second place, it frequently happened that Jutland, or
Zealand, or Scania was subdued by the neighbouring
kings of Norway and Sweden, and they were, without
hesitation, admitted as kings of Denmark. Add the
number of revolutions inseparable from such a lawless
state of society,—where king after king was driven into
exile, or put to death, or forced to bend, for a while,
before the torrent of invasion,—and we can scarcely be
surprised at the difference, extreme as it is, between the
lists of Scandinavian kings. Where, however, accuracy
is not to be attained, or even an approximation to it,
conjecture is useless. The personages whose names and
presumed dates are to be found in the note below<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>who are received by modern historians, certainly ruled
over some part of Denmark; but whether they were all
that ruled in that country,—whether some of them did
not reign in the more northern provinces,—whether
they reigned in the order assigned to them,—may well
be doubted.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a> It would be easy to construct a new list,
as probable, at least, as any of those which we have
transcribed in the notes; but where Torfœus, and Suhm,
and other recent writers have failed, there would be
something like presumption in the attempt. We are
bound to declare that little dependence is to be placed
on any one that northern erudition has yet formed;
nearly as little on Suhm’s as on any that preceded it.
For this reason we have inserted the three most common
lists, leaving the reader to admit or reject whatever
names he pleases. Again, however, we must caution
him not to reject any merely on the ground of their
having been omitted by more recent writers. Denmark
had, sometimes,—indeed, we might say frequently,—three
or four sovereigns at the same time; and when
their power was nearly balanced, nothing could be more
difficult than to say which of them was the legitimate
Rex Danorum. Nor can this confusion, at the present
day, be surprising, when we find Adam of Bremen complaining
of it. “Tanti autem reges, immo tyranni
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Danorum, utrum simul aliqui regnaverunt, an alter post
alterum brevi tempore vixit, incertum est.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Of these kings, down to the ninth century, very
little is known. The truth is, most of them were petty
feudal chiefs, inconsiderable as those of the Scottish
Highlands, during the middle ages. It is acknowledged
by the most critical of the Danes themselves, that even
the islands which now constitute so small a portion of
the monarchy were not united under one sceptre until
the middle of the fourth century. This honour is
ascribed to Dan, surnamed Mykillati, or the Magnanimous,
the sixth in descent from Skiold. There can,
however, be no doubt that both a too early period has
been assigned to this event, and that a dismemberment
of these islands was frequently effected. Certainly
we read of independent principalities in them as
late as the eighth century. Jutland, which forms
so considerable a portion of the monarchy, had its
separate governors, or kings, who, though sometimes
dependent on the kings of Zealand, were often at war
with them, and rulers over them. Doubtless the peninsula
and islands were frequently under the same
sceptre; but the union was a violent one, and was preserved
only as long as the victor had the necessary
means to reward obedience. If we read of such unions
as early as the fifth century, or even the fourth, we also
read of separate kings in Jutland as late as the ninth.
The truth is, when the author of the forced union paid
the debt of nature, the monarchy was immediately
dismembered, and its separate parts received their local
rulers. Where, from time immemorial, island has been
at war with island, district with district, nothing is so
difficult as to effect a cordial union between them.
Ages are required to destroy the hostility which ages
have confirmed. Those isolated governments preserved
no record of their transactions; the memory of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>was perpetuated by tradition alone, or by the metrical
songs to which that tradition gave rise. Both <i>create</i>
in a degree much greater than they perpetuate,—a fact
illustrated by the whole course of northern history prior
to the ninth century. Hence the confusion, the contradictions,
the darkness which rest upon it, and the impossibility
of yielding much credence to the relations of
ancient or modern writers on the subject. As, however,
all these relations have some foundation in truth,
it would be unwise, and even unjust, to bury in utter
oblivion the names and alleged deeds of the kings antecedent
to the historic times.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Of <i>Skiold</i>, the reputed founder of the monarchy, who
was probably king of Zealand only, though he might
have a nominal superiority over the rest, we have
little even in the way of fable. To his great bodily
strength and indomitable courage, which are communicated
by Saxo, we have before alluded<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a>; and in the
same manner we have alluded to the deeds, real or fabulous,
of his more immediate successors. <i>Frode I.</i>, whom
Saxo calls Frode III., was no less valiant than Skiold,
since he conquered from Hungary to Iceland, and from
Sweden to the south of Germany. The truth probably
is, that he joined some one of the warlike confederations,
then so common, against the power of Rome; and that
the expedition into Germany, being undertaken rather
for plunder than for glory, was successful. But this
prince deserves greater praise, from the zeal with which
he destroyed the numerous banditti, humbled the tyrannical
nobles, protected the poor, and reformed the
tribunals of his kingdom. Some of his edicts were
severe. He who suffered a thief to escape should
himself suffer the punishment of one. He who fled
in battle should be accounted a public enemy. If one
Dane robbed another, he was to return twofold, and at
the same time suffer public chastisement. If a man
gave refuge to a thief, with the stolen property about
him, he was to be whipped in a public assembly of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>people, and regarded as <i>criminis particeps</i>. If any one
banished for his crimes fought against his native country,
he forfeited both property and life. In some of his other
regulations there was more humanity. To females he
gave the power of marrying whomsoever they wished,
provided they chose a mate in an equal condition of
life; for the free woman who married or sinned with
a slave, became a slave herself. If a man forced a
woman, he was compelled to marry her. In other
respects the laws which he promulgated, or rather confirmed,
were nearly identical with those of the Germanic
tribes, that, in a former publication, occupied so
much of our attention.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a> If there be any truth in history,
they were eminently successful; for it is recorded
of Frode I., as of a few other sovereigns, that when
articles of value were left on the highway, no man presumed
to touch them. He was the great patron of
valour: slaves were not, as in other Germanic tribes,
forbidden the use of arms; nor were they deprived of
the hope of liberty, since a single act of valour would
elevate them in the social grade. The real actions,
however, of this prince are so mingled with fable,—fable
at once grotesque and imaginative,—that we know
not what to believe respecting him. That he once
lived; that he was a great warrior; that he was generally
victorious; that his internal administration was
vigorous; that he was an unrivalled pirate,—his fleets
committing depredations on all the coasts of the Baltic,—cannot
be disputed with much reason. His was
the heroic age. The north swarmed with kings. On
one occasion, alone, thirty were assembled in the Baltic.
Did they recognise a superior authority? Probably
they did; for Frode was frequently accompanied by
these tributaries. The truth seems to be, that when
any sovereign of Jutland, or Scania, or Sigtun, or any
other place in Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, obtained
much celebrity as a warrior, the local chiefs—who
always assumed the regal title—were always ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>seek his protection, and to serve under his banner.
Though this obedience was temporary, a preference was
usually given to such of the more powerful kings as
were of the divine race,—the race of Odin; but amidst
the vicissitudes inseparable from such a state of society,
a fortunate adventurer often dispossessed the legitimate
claimant; and on ascending a throne illustrated by
glorious recollections, his own personal qualities gave
him an immediate ascendancy over most of his royal
neighbours.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The reign of Frode should not be dismissed without
adverting to the hero who shed the most lustre on it,
the renowned Arngrim, and to his magic sword, Tyrfing,
the destroyer of men. According to Saxo, he
was a Swedish champion, who, having triumphed over
another hero, had the boldness to demand from Frode
the hand of Osura, daughter of that monarch. Finding
the royal Dane too proud to listen to him, he was
advised by Eric of Sweden to achieve something more
splendid than he had yet attempted, and then to renew
his suit. Without loss of time he led his small but
valiant band of warriors against two petty kings,—the
one of Biarmia, the other of Finland,—who had despised
the Danish power. “The Finns,” says the
historian, “are the last people towards the north, and
their region is so barren as scarcely to be habitable.
They are good marksmen: no people surpass them in
throwing missiles. They fight with long and broad
arrows, are skilful in magical incantations, and delight
in hunting. Their abode is variable. They wander
about and encamp wherever they can find wild beasts.
Borne on sledges, they traverse with safety the snowy
peaks of the mountains.” Of their skill in magic,
Arngrim had immediate proof. He defeated them,
indeed; but then they cast three stones behind them,
which, though very small stones, seemed to their pursuers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>huge as mountains. The trick succeeded; for
Arngrim, discouraged by the abrupt eminences and
steep rocks before him, recalled his men. The next
day, through the same power of song, a vast river
seemed to interpose between the invaders and the
natives, and the former again returned. The third
day, however, the Swedes were not to be deluded; the
Finns were defeated, and compelled to pay tribute.
The king of Biarmia shared the same fate, and Arngrim,
on his return, became the son-in-law of Frode.
By the princess, Osura, he had, subsequently, twelve
sons, all of whom became hardy pirates, the most
honourable profession then known in the north. But
their end was tragical. Landing one day in the isle of
Samsoe, they destroyed the crews of two boats,—all
pirates like themselves. But their joy was short. By
the two chiefs, who had penetrated into the interior,
they were suddenly assailed, and destroyed to the last
of the number, one of the victors, Hialmar, dying of
the wounds which he had received.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This relation by the Danish historian, which, with
the exception of the magical incidents, is probably
true, is too simple for the Scalds, who have reared on
this basis a long and most ingenious narrative,—one
that may aspire to the dignity of an epic. We
dwell upon it, however, not for the fancy that created
it, but for the light which it throws upon the manners
of the period. In ancient times there reigned a king
called Swafurlam, whose grandfather had received the
dominion from the awful hands of Odin himself. He
was no less valiant than his ancestor. He had no
sooner succeeded to the inheritance than he was called
to revenge his father’s death on a famous giant, the terror
of the north. He killed the monster, and took to
wife Frida, the beautiful daughter of the slain. Such
adventures are of perpetual occurrence in the histories
of the north. The life of no chief was secure; at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>any moment he might be surprised and slain, or defied
to mortal combat, by one his superior in strength or
skill. In the event of his fall, his wife, his children,
all he had, became the property of the victor. In general,
the Norwegian maiden—if she had no prior
attachment—passed without much reluctance into
the arms of her father’s murderer. That father she
could not by her tears recall to life; and she might be
happy with one who had acted in conformity with the
manners of the age, and who certainly might be able
to protect her, in a state of society in which women
stood most in need of protection. Frida was satisfied
with her lot; so far, at least, as Swafurlam was concerned.
She had, indeed, reason to lament that a
daughter was the only issue of their union; that no
Herculean boys were rising before her to protect both
herself and her husband, when age should have bent his
sinewy frame. That period she knew must come,
though Time might do his work more slowly with him
than with less vigorous men. But it was not his lot
to fall into “the sear and yellow leaf.” Before his
strength had time to leave him, there arrived in those
parts a champion, whose object was to defy and vanquish
every hero of note. This was Arngrim, who
had never yet fled before mortal man; who in every
duel had been victorious. Swafurlam did not much
relish the approaching struggle. Still less did Frida,
who could not avoid remembering the death of her
father, or fearing that her husband might share the
same fate. Eyvor, too, their beautiful daughter, was
apprehensive of the result; for this Arngrim, who
was young and vigorous, while her father was past
life’s meridian, was a <i>berserk</i>, that is, shirtless,—one
that wore no defensive armour,—that trusted only to
his own strength, which, during certain fits of madness,
was increased in a prodigious measure. When
these fits were on him he despised steel, water, fire, as
much as if they were harmless; nor did he care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>whether the foe he had to oppose were one or one
thousand. He, therefore, was not likely to prove an
invincible husband,—to atone for the loss of a father.
To conceal his uneasiness, or rather to divert that
ominous feeling which men sometimes experience on
the eve of a great crisis, Swafurlam went into the
mountains to hunt.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a> A beautiful white stag soon
appeared in sight, and was as soon pursued; but nothing
could equal the creature’s provoking coolness.
It was not frightened; it was not hurried; it ran,
then turned round as if waiting for its pursuers, and
just when they believed they were on the point of
seizing it, it bounded forward to delude them a second
time. Never was the king so ardent in the sport.
Night descended; still he rode on; and the beams of
the full unclouded moon enabled him to see everything
nearly as well as in the broad daylight. Midnight
came; still the hunters were following the stag. But
it suddenly disappeared through an opening in the
rocks, leaving Swafurlam in a terrible rage at the loss
of his prey. Two dwarfs—so the Icelanders call the
<i>fairies</i>—issued from the opening, and these he drew
his sword to destroy, when, remembering that the
whole race were skilful in the manufacture of enchanted
weapons, he promised to spare their lives on the condition
that, within three days, they would make him
one that should never miss its blow—that should
never rust—that should cut the hardest steel as easily
as leather—that should always bring victory to the
owner. The covenant was made; and, at the end of
three days, Swafurlam returned for the weapon. It
was ready for him, and on one side of the blade was
written,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Draw me not, unless in fray;</div>
      <div class='line'>Drawn, I pierce; and piercing, slay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>And he was at the same time cautioned, though in
terms somewhat oracular, to beware of the weapon.
On his return home he found that Arngrim had reached
it. The latter was treated with the utmost hospitality.
For him the sable hams were soaked and boiled, the
wild fowl were placed on the spit, vegetables boiled,
new bread made, the ale cask tapped, the table spread
with the abundant feast, and the minstrel’s song made
to enliven an entertainment which the fine hands of
mother and daughter had prepared, and which both
honoured with their presence. This was, truly, more
than Homeric: the most magnanimous of Grecian
dames would not have thus welcomed the man who was
about to engage in mortal conflict with husband or
brother. The feelings of the wife, indeed, on beholding
the sinewy frame of the guest, must have been
painful: her heart failed her; and she was glad when
the increasing power of the cup authorised her and her
daughter to retire. The following day her worst fears
were verified. Though Swafurlam, at the first onset,
cleft in two the shield of his adversary, the very force
of his blow was fatal to him: he struck his magic
sword into the ground, and, before he could withdraw
it, his right hand was amputated by the berserk, who
snatched the weapon from the lifeless member and
gave the king a mortal wound in the head. Eyvor
became the wife of the victor, who bore her, no less
than the spoils of her father’s palace, to his Norwegian
home.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It was now Eyvor’s turn to be anxious. Might not a
warrior, still more valiant than her husband, arrive, and
render her, like her mother, a forsaken widow? Might
not the weapon which had cost her father his life prove
equally fatal to one dearer? Often did she request
him to bury it under ground; but he was in no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>humour to part with his most valued treasure, especially
as it enabled him to return invincible from all
his expeditions. Her fears, however, for <i>him</i> were
vain: they should have been excited for her twelve
sons, whom she bore in twelve years after her marriage,
and who were all warriors—all berserks—all
doomed to an early grave. One of them vowed to the
god Braga that he would have to wife the princess
Ingburga, or perish in the attempt. As all were
brothers in arms no less than brothers in blood, all
bound to assist each individual of the number, to make
the cause of each a common cause, they took the same
view. Arngrim, now waxen in years, took his leave of
them with a heavy heart; he felt that he must see
them no more; and his only consolation was, that
when the Nornies, or fatal sisters, call, they will be
obeyed. They had to fight on the desert isle of Samsoe
with two heroes, Hialmar and Oddur, each at the head
of a hundred Swedes, and each renowned for prowess
throughout the north. The former, too, was the accepted
lover of Ingburga, accepted by her father no
less than by herself. On their way to the island, the
eldest of Arngrim’s twelve sons, Angantyr, took to wife
Swafa, the daughter of a celebrated jarl, and their
course was much delayed by the festivities demanded
on the occasion. This jarl had the same dark forebodings
as their own father. Fain would he have
persuaded them to remain with them; but their honour
would not allow of this, and away they sailed. On
their landing at the place appointed, their accustomed
fit seized them, and they destroyed the 200 followers
of Hialmar and Oddur, who were then absent in the
interior of the island. Mighty was the destruction, by
Tyrfing, which was wielded by the powerful Angantyr,
and which, on this occasion, might truly be called the
death of men. Hialmar and Oddur soon returned to
find their companions drenched in gore; but, fortunately
for the two heroes, the strength of the berserks
was now greatly diminished—in other words, the fit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>was over, and they were become like other men. Still
the magic sword and the superiority of numbers compensated
to the sons of Arngrim for their somewhat
exhausted spirits. They would have more than compensated
had not Oddur worn a quilted coat, which
magic rendered impenetrable to the keenest weapon.
The conflict soon engaged. On the one hand, Hialmar
was opposed to Angantyr with the magic sword; on
the other, Oddur, with the magic quilt, encountered,
one by one in succession, the eleven brothers of Angantyr.
After a terrible struggle of some length,
Hialmar fell, pierced by the dreaded Tyrfing, but
Angantyr also received a mortal wound, and Oddur
slew all his eleven antagonists. The dead were buried
by the only survivor, the fatal sword being buried
along with Angantyr, according to the last request
of that hero.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The widow of Angantyr bemoaned the death of her
valiant husband. For a time she refused consolation;
but finding herself pregnant, she began to hope that
her issue would avenge the death of father and uncles.
Though she gave birth to a female child, still hope did
not forsake her. From infancy, indeed, Hervor delighted
in masculine pursuits. Her stature was equal
to that of the other sex; and her spirit was in no
respect inferior. No sooner did she approach woman’s
estate than she exhibited all her natural ferocity. She
put on armour; did no little mischief; and when upbraided
for her excess, fled to the woods, to rob and
murder passengers. In vain did her guardians endeavour
to rescue her from such pursuits; in vain did
they try to conceal from her the circumstances which
preceded her birth, and even her parentage, pretending
that she was the daughter of a mere shepherd, and the
offspring of an incestuous connection. But she had
seen or dreamt far other things; and, despising her
present inaction, she resumed her masculine attire, and
joined a band of pirates, of whom, in a short time, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>became the chief. Her fame, under the name of
Herward, was widely spread. Many were the coasts
which she visted and laid waste. At length, coming to
the isle of Samsoe, where she heard her father and
kindred were buried, she announced to her followers
her resolution to go on shore for the purpose of despoiling
the tombs of the hidden treasure. They assured
her that the whole island was infested by malignant
genii,—that it was the most dangerous of all places.
But nothing could deter her from her purpose. A
shepherd, whom she met, wondered at her temerity;
told her that she must be ignorant, indeed, of the
terrors of the place, since no one could be there after
sunset without extreme peril; and invited her to accept
of such hospitality as his humble cottage afforded.
After that time, he added, the tombs, and the very
ground, emitted such flames that no one who remained
could be safe. She could not be moved; asserted that
if the whole island was on fire, she would not fear;
and insisted on knowing the exact spot where the
tombs might be found. Amazed at her audacity, and
supposing her to be a fool, the shepherd ran home
before the departure of the sun should permit the
demons to injure him; while she penetrated into the
island. She soon reached the dreadful scene. Fires
issued from the sepulchres, the inmates of which
wandered about; fires issued from the path itself, before,
behind, around her. Still she proceeded, with spirit
undaunted, until she came to the greatest of the tombs,
that which contained the ashes of her father, Angantyr.
There she commenced her incantation, which is abridged
below.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a> The subsequent adventures of Hervor and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>wondrous sword must be briefly related. On her return
to the sea-shore, she found that her companions, terrified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>by the unusual fires and the sudden thunder, had fled.
At length, however, a ship bore her to the court of
Godmund, an aged king, with whom she remained a
short time only, owing to the fatal Tyrfing. As she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>was one day watching the king and his son at play,
she perceived a domestic of the palace draw the weapon
which she had left on her seat. Knowing that the
prophecy must be fulfilled by the death of some one
present, she ran to the domestic, took the weapon from
him, killed him, left the palace, and again betook herself
to the piratical life. Her fame, both for valour
and beauty, was so great, that Hafod, the son of Godmund,
solicited and obtained her hand. Of this marriage
the issue were Angantyr and Heidrek,—the
former noted for his excellent, the latter for his mischievous
qualities, both far surpassing the rest of mankind
in stature and valour. Heidrek was the favourite
of Hervor; Angantyr, of her husband; but such were
the ill qualities of the younger prince, that by Hafod
he was not allowed to remain at court, but was sent
away to be educated by one of the heroes of the time.
On reaching his eighteenth year, he visited the palace
without the consent of his father; but his disposition
leading him to embroil the guests in a fatal affray,
he was exiled by Hafod, who had succeeded to the
throne of Godmund. Hervor, being permitted to bid
him adieu, presented him with the magic sword,—the
best gift in the power of a fond mother to bestow.
The prophecy of her father, Angantyr, when she so
rashly took it from the tomb, was immediately fulfilled.
Heidrek drew it, brandished it, and, whether intentionally
or otherwise, slew his brother Angantyr. To escape
his father’s anger, which doomed him to death, he fled
into the woods, living on the produce of the chase, and
pursued by remorse. By his sword he freed king
Harald of Sweden from the oppressive sway of two
great chiefs. In return, he received the hand of the
monarch’s daughter, and by her had a son, whom he
called, after his own brother, Angantyr. But the sword
Tyrfing was doomed to make sad havock among his
connections. In his hands it was soon fatal to Harald,
his father-in-law; and this event led his royal bride
to hang herself. Some years afterwards he undertook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the education of a Norwegian prince, whom he
loved. One day, while hunting in the forest, his spear
broke, and he immediately drew the formidable Tyrfing.
As it could not be returned to the scabbard
until it had tasted some blood, and as the prince, only,
was with him, the beloved innocent fell beneath the
weapon. But it was, at length, fatal to himself. One
night, while he was asleep in his tent, his slaves rose,
drew Tyrfing, and slew him. His son Angantyr pursued
them, slew them by night, and thus recovered the
weapon. In the hands of the new possessor it still
vindicated its fated character. With it, in open battle,
he slew his brother, whom a Swedish princess had born
to Heidrek. At length, however, it seems to have been
again buried in the tomb of its victim; and, fortunately
for the north, no Hervor subsequently arose to
charm it from the ghastly hand which held it.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Angantyr, like all his race, was a hero by profession,
a champion who fought as much for reputation as for
plunder. This institution is one of the most singular
features in northern history. Sometimes a champion
fought alone, wandering, like the knight errants of a
later age, from country to country, not, however, to
relieve distressed captives, or to perform any other act
of humanity, but to triumph, by strength or dexterity,
over the most renowned warriors of the time. Generally,
however, these men were members of some fraternity,
the guards of some king, whose first duty was
to defend his person, on land or sea; their second to
humble his enemies, or assist his allies. “The sagas,”
observes a modern writer, who has devoted much of his
time to northern antiquities, “are filled with duels, or
single combats, between these champions and their
adversaries, and the scene was generally some little
island near the coast. These combats, in which one
champion sometimes vanquished and slew many enemies,
and which took place also between sea or land
kings and champions, were so frequent, that he who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was just entering on the career of arms, or who desired
to obtain a wider reputation, betook himself to this
medium, and without the least motive of hatred or
resentment, provoked other champions, other pirates, to
fight him. These heroes entered into associations, or
fraternities, which they sealed with their blood, and
which death only could dissolve. Sometimes they
were furnished by the kings or chiefs whom they served
with statutes, fixing their number, their privileges, and
duties.” In general, the statutes excluded all warriors
under eighteen or beyond sixty years of age. The
number in each fraternity varied from half a dozen to
fifty. Rolf, a prince of Norway, had a famous society
of this kind. No man unable to lift a stone, or rather
rock, which lay in the court-yard of the prince, and
which twelve ordinary men could not raise, was admitted
into the body. Lest they should become luxurious,
they were forbidden to sleep under a roof; with
the same view, they were to shun female society; to
inspire them with contempt for pain and danger, they
were not to have their wounds dressed before the end
of the battle, or to seek a shelter during a storm at sea.
But all fraternities were not thus rigorously excluded
from intercourse with the fair sex. To most heroes,
indeed, the opportunities which the profession afforded
of capturing handsome women and rendering them
their companions by sea and land, was the chief inducement
to embrace it. In such an age, no handsome
woman—at least, if high-born—could be safe. By
night or day her dwelling might be assailed, her guardians
slain, and herself borne to the swift vessel waiting
for her. What, indeed, could resist a chief surrounded
by so many champions, especially if they happened to be
berserks? If there be any truth in history, the strength
of these men when the fit came upon them was supernatural.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
The mischief, however, was, that if they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>no enemy before them, they assailed inanimate objects,
or even one another. On one occasion, twelve heroes
(the sons of Arngrim) fell upon the masts and deck of
two ships, which they rent into splinters; and when
these were destroyed, they turned their rage against the
trees and rocks. On another, a celebrated sea king put
to death six out of the twelve champions who accompanied
him. Sometimes, too, it happened that the
berserks, when under the dominion of their strange
frenzy, did not spare themselves. Thus the five sons
of Siwald, king of Sweden, were seen to throw themselves
into the fire, and to swallow burning pieces of
wood.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>When these warriors, whether berserks or simple
champions, fought for their chief and country, their
services were useful. But sometimes it happened that
they were as fond of turning their arms against their
fellow-subjects as against their hereditary enemies.
Others, again, openly embraced the career of bandits;
and though pursued with great zeal by the neighbouring
chiefs, were frequently able, from their mountain
fastnesses, to defy all hostility. Such a band <i>Fridleif II.</i>
resolved to destroy; and he succeeded in his object, but
more through stratagem than force. He was, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>a valiant chief. Like many other northern kings, he
had to fight for his wife. Seeing that he could not
obtain Frogerth, daughter of Asmund, a king of Norway,
by the ordinary way of embassy, he invaded the
country, subdued and slew the father, and seized upon
the princess. But he was not faithful to her. By a
concubine—or, perhaps, another wife, for these old
pagans did not exactly understand the difference between
the two—he had a son, whom he named Olaf. Probably
he loved this son more than prince Frode, whom
Frogerth bore to him: so, at least, we should infer
from the anxiety with which he consulted the fates in
reference to the child’s fortunes. Having performed
the usual rites, and said the usual prayers, he entered
the temple of the Nornies. Each of the three sisters
occupied her seat. Two were favourable to the child,
whom they endowed with noble gifts; but the third
lessened their value by associating them with avarice.
This custom, Saxo assures us, prevailed among the
ancients. Of Olaf, however, we read no more: the
sceptre was not inherited by him, but by <i>Frode II.</i>, if
Saxo be right, and by Havar, if any faith is to be
placed on the Icelandic chroniclers. But as, for the
reasons we have already detailed, there is little certainty
in the royal lists of either, we gladly leave
their disputed order of succession to be settled by the
native historians of Denmark.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The reigns of Frode and of <i>Ingel</i>, his son, have
little interest beyond what they derive from their association
with the name of Sterkodder, the Hercules of
the north, whose exploits were in the mouths of all
men, even in Saxo’s time. The gigantic limbs, the
indomitable spirit of this hero, were regarded as supernatural,—as
the gifts of the gods to answer a certain
purpose. According to some, it was Thor who knit
together the sinews of his frame; others gave the
honour to Odin. This deity, say the legends, being
anxious to destroy Wikar, a king of Norway, yet unwilling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to do so openly, destined Sterkodder to this
service, from his cradle. Hence his enormous size and
force of mind: hence, also, his skill in poetry, which
was to assist him in the great enterprise before him.
Grateful for their gifts, and for the protracted existence
which had been decreed him, he soon devised the means
of pleasing the god. He offered his services as a
champion to Wikar, who, being justly proud of such a
companion in arms, was inseparable from him. After
some maritime expeditions, undertaken for the sole
object of plunder, he found an opportunity of effecting
Wikar’s destruction. A tempest of unusual fury was
still more unusual from its duration. The gods were
evidently offended, and must be appeased by human
blood. Lots were cast into the urn, and the king’s
name was drawn as the victim. The crew, indeed,
were horrified at the thought of sacrificing a king,—and
they wished him to be executed in appearance
only; but Sterkodder, preferring the reality,
strangled Wikar, then opened his body and examined
his entrails, as gravely as any aruspex of ancient
Rome. He then betook himself to a piratical life,
and obtained even more celebrity for his admirable
continence than for his exploits, superhuman as they
were. He never partook, even slightly, of intoxicating
liquors: he never indulged in the remotest
species of luxury. His services to different kings (for
he was truly a wandering champion, a knight errant of
those barbarous times) are the constant theme of admiration.
Throughout the whole of northern Europe,
from Russia and Hungary to Iceland, his fame was
spread. Probably there were several heroes of this
name, and the exploits of all ascribed to one. Frode
was one of his favourite masters, and one whose bravery
he admired. But on the accession of Ingel, the son of
Frode, whose luxury and intemperance contrasted
strongly with the sobriety of the late king, and still
more with his own, he would no longer remain at the
court of Denmark. Yet he always bore an affectionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>regard for the offspring of Frode. Thus, when he
heard that Helga, the sister of Ingel, had so forgotten
her royal dignity as to receive, without indignation, the
addresses of a low mechanic (auri apifex obscuræ stinpis),
full of zeal for the honour of her house, he
hastened to her residence, killed the mechanic, and
sharply upbraided her for the baseness of her inclinations.
On another occasion, however, he gratified as
much as he had now offended her. Her hand being
sought by Helge, a king of Norway, Ingel replied that
he should have it on the condition of his fighting with
certain champions. He accepted the condition; but
when he heard that his opponents, whom he was to
fight all at once, were Angantyr and eight brothers,
sons of a Zealand chief<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a>, he was alarmed for the result.
He consulted Helga, who seems to have had little difficulty
in transferring her affections from a dead to a
living suitor, what he should do; and she advised, to
implore the aid of Sterkodder, then in Sweden. He
hastened to the veteran warrior, who readily promised
to serve the daughter of Frode. This promise he fulfilled
by hastening to the court of Ingel, and killing all
the nine champions. But the wounds of the victor
were many and severe, being seventeen in number,
and his bowels protruding from some of them. In
this state he dragged himself to the banks of a river, to
quench his thirst; but the water being corrupted by
the blood of the combatants, he refused to drink of it;
and with great difficulty he crept to a rock near at
hand, and sat upon it. So huge was his bulk, that it
left a deep impression on the stone. (Saxo, indeed,
believes that this impression was made by human hands,
and not by the body of Sterkodder.) While in this
position, in the utmost need of help, the proud soul of
the warrior refused to receive it from base hands. A
herald, or rather spy, passed by, and offered aid. It
was refused, and the man cursed for his presumption.
Another passed, and being asked his condition, replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that, though he was free, he had married a slave, and
to procure her enfranchisement, he laboured for her
master. The hero upbraided him for his base inclination;—why
did he not take a free woman to his bed?—and
bade him begone. A female now approached,
and being asked her condition, replied that she was a
slave, and the mother of an infant child; he bade her
go home and give suck to her brat, for he would have
none of her help. Next passed a free-born peasant,
whose good offices he received, and whose honourable
calling he praised. After the lapse of some time, he
repaired to the palace of Ingel, whom he resolved to
upbraid for two things;—for unbecoming dissipation,
and for neglecting the most important filial duties,—the
revenge of Frode’s death. In a mean disguise he
entered the hall of feasting, and seated himself in an
honourable place. He was immediately commanded,
by the queen, to remove to one more becoming his fortunes.
He arose, went to the other end of the hall,
and seated himself on the bench with such force as to
shake the building, and threaten the fall of the roof.
At this moment king Ingel returned from the chase,
recognised the veteran warrior, upbraided the queen for
her neglect of so illustrious a guest, and endeavoured,
by the best attentions, to dissipate his anger. But
when he perceived at the royal table the sons of Swerting,
the murderers of Frode, and the ostentatious
luxury of the feast, he grew still darker. To appease
him, the queen drew a coronet from her brow, and
presented it to him; yet he not only rejected it, but
threw it in her face. To charm him, the lute was
played: he sat like a statue, scorning alike the host,
the guests, the costly viands. A trumpet next sounded:
he threw a bone which he was picking at the head of
the musician. But his chief wrath was turned against
the king, whom he apostrophised in no measured terms.
At length Ingel was affected by his reproaches; he
drew his sword; Sterkodder did the same; and the
floor was soon covered with the blood of the murderers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>After this exploit, the champion, in great joy, took
leave of the king, whom he saw no more. One of his
remaining actions was little worthy of his fame. By
twelve conspirators of Zealand, who detested the yoke
of Olo, their king, he was bribed to murder that sovereign,
and he did so in the bath. The reward which
he received for this inglorious deed—one hundred
and twenty pounds of gold—afforded him no pleasure:
remorse took possession of his soul; he sighed whenever
the name of Olo was mentioned; and his days
were miserable. In addition to this calamity, age and
blindness visited him; and he became so weary of life,
that he resolved to leave it. To die in the ordinary
course of nature was not fitting a champion, still less one
that aspired to the banquets of Odin.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Supporting
himself on two crutches, with two swords at his side,
he placed himself by the highway, having round
his neck the gold which he had received for the murder
of Olo, and which was to be the reward of the man
who should do the same friendly office for him. But
he scorned to die by an ignoble hand; and when a
rustic, thinking two swords were too many for an old
man, asked him for one, he bade the rustic approach
for it, and killed him on the spot. Two companions
of a prince whose father Sterkodder had killed, one day
advanced against him; but he killed both with his
crutches. The prince, struck with equal admiration
and fear, approached, and a conversation of some length,
in which the hero boasted of his past deeds, followed
between them. At the conclusion, Sterkodder, aware
of the youth’s noble birth, and convinced that he could
not die by a better hand, begged Hother to kill him,
and held out his sword for the purpose. The prince
hesitated; but being told that the act would be a pious
duty towards the manes of his father, and being still
more influenced by the view of the gold, he separated
the head from the gigantic body of the hero.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Whatever portion of the marvellous may exist in
such stories as the preceding, no doubt can be entertained
of their being founded in truth. But if they
were not, they could not be wholly omitted, unless we
were resolved to shut our eyes to the national manners.
Of such manners—the best part of history—they are
the best, we may add, the only, mirrors. Nor is the
state of human opinion, as modified by education, climate,
and habits, a less interesting object of contemplation.
For this reason, and because of the dearth of
genuine events during this ante-historic period, we have
drawn, and for some pages must continue to draw, more
largely on the traditionary lore of Scandinavia than we
should do were those events more abundant and better
established. Now for another legend, wilder than any
of the preceding. <i>Gorm I.</i>, king of Denmark, a prince
not mentioned in the list of Suhm, yet who undoubtedly
reigned in Jutland, was exceedingly fond of exploring
the secrets of nature, of visiting everything
wonderful, of enlarging his knowledge. From the inhabitants
of Thule he had heard of the wondrous seat
of Geruth, one of the gigantic magicians who, in ancient
times, had been opposed to the gods of Asheim; but the
place was considered as all but inaccessible to mortals,
as surrounded with dangers which would make the boldest
quail. But dangers were just the things which most
excited the enterprise of Gorm, and he resolved to sail
in quest of the mysterious place. He was to follow the
course of the mighty ocean, which, like a circle, surrounded
the earth<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a>; to leave the sun and the stars
behind; to penetrate into ancient chaos,—into regions
deprived of light, and beset with terrors of every kind.
Three hundred men, in three vessels, agreed to accompany
their king; and all were to be under the guidance
of Thorkil, who had already performed the voyage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Thorkil lost no time in giving additional strength to the
vessels, in covering them with thick hides of leather, so
as to prevent the ingress of the waters, and in filling
them with suitable provisions. The expedition, and
after many, many days, arrived off the coast of Halogia<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a>,
or the country of the Lapps; on they then sailed, until
their provisions began to fail, the storm to rage, the sea
to dash its deafening billows against the rocks. A
nimble youth was commanded to ascend the mast, and
see whether land was nigh; he shouted out that an
island, of abrupt, precipitous access, lay within sight.
The delighted crew steered for the place, moored their
vessels, and ascended the cliffs. Thorkil warned them
not to seize, from the numerous herds of cattle now
visible, more than was sufficient to satisfy their present
hunger; if they did, the avenging deities of the place
would prevent their return home. But when the famishing
men perceived how easily the unsuspecting
beasts were taken, they forgot the warning, and killed
enough to load their ships. The night following, as
they lay in their beds on board they were terrified
with strange noises, and still more with the appearance
of monstrous forms running along the shore.
One of these, more gigantic than the rest, walked on
the sea, with a huge club in his hand, and cried aloud
that they could not sail until they had expiated the injury
done to the sacred herd, by delivering one man
from each vessel. Thorkil, perceiving that there was
no escape, and preferring the safety of the many to that
of the few, commanded the lots to be drawn, and the
victims to be delivered. The wind now became favourable,
and the vessels proceeded to the farther Biarmia.
This was a region of eternal cold, covered with deep
snows, and with pathless forests, destitute of fertility,
and abounding with strange beasts; here were many
rivers, pouring along their waters with ceaseless noise,
owing to the rocky impediments in their course. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>this coast Thorkil directed the prows of the vessels,
assuring his companions that they were now come to the
place which immediately led to the abode of Geruth.
He warned them not to speak with the inhabitants, but
to leave that office to him, who was acquainted with the
customs of the place. Towards twilight, a mighty giant
approached, and saluted the sailors by name; this was
Guthmund, the brother of Geruth, the protector of
strangers. They gazed, admired, and were silent. When
asked by the giant the reason of their silence, Thorkil
replied that they were unacquainted with his speech.
Guthmund received them into his chariots, and proceeded
with them towards his palace. A golden bridge
lay within sight, and some were inclined to pass over
it. “If you do,” said Thorkil, “you will repent: this
river, so full of monstrous beings, separates the human
from other natures, and beyond it is no footing for
man.” They soon came to the house of their host, and
here it was doubly necessary for Thorkil to repeat his
warnings: he assured them, they were literally surrounded
by destruction. They must not eat of the
food placed before them, but eat what they had brought
with them, and seat themselves at a distance from the
natives. They must equally shun the embraces of the
women; for Guthmund had twelve lovely daughters,
all ministers of the table, and all frail enough. If they
yielded to any of these temptations, they would instantly
lose the remembrance of the past, and would
pass the remainder of their days with herds of monstrous
beasts. The terrified strangers observed his directions;
but Guthmund was offended with them for despising
his hospitality: he was particularly so with king Gorm.
But Thorkil had a ready excuse. Strange food, the
latter observed, did not agree with many persons, and
was frequently the cause of disease; it was so with the
king, who was obliged to live on certain kinds of food,
which he could only be sure of finding in his own
kitchen: hence the host should not be offended with
that which implied no want of respect to himself, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a prudent attention to one’s own health. This temptation
having failed, the giant offered his daughters to
the king; and to the rest, other maidens of his household.
This was indeed a temptation. Thorkil, in a low
voice, repeated his warning; but four of the number
yielded, and were immediately deprived of memory,
and, in a great degree, of reason. Now for a third
temptation. Guthmund had a delightful garden, the
fruits of which were unequalled: Thorkil prevailed on
his men to refuse the offer, and accompanied the refusal
with much feigned politeness. Seeing that he could
have no more than the four victims, the giant transported
them over the river.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond this stream the adventurers perceived, at no
great distance, a dark, unfrequented city, resembling a
cloud of smoke. On high poles, grinned mortal heads,
dissevered from their bodies; and below the entrance,
which could only be reached by ladders, yelled hideous
dogs, ready to devour the travellers. The entrails of a
beast, cast before them by Thorkil, satisfied their howls,
and the whole party ascended to the gate. Within, the
whole town was possessed by dark larvæ, whose horrid
noise, as they hovered about, were ended by the
frightfulness of their shapes: all within was putrid,
intolerable to the eye, and still more so to the breath.
Onward the adventurers went, and entered a stony cavern
which, according to tradition, had been the palace
of Geruth. The horrible gloom within made them
pause on the threshold, but Thorkil encouraged them to
proceed; at the same time, he warned them to beware
of taking or touching anything, however inviting to the
eye; to restrain their minds from avarice as from fear;
to desire nothing, to dread nothing; for if they laid
a covetous hand on any desirable object, that hand would
instantly become immoveable, and the whole body as if
it were inextricably fettered. Their guide then directed
them to enter in fours: Broder and Buchi led the way;
Thorkil and the king followed; the rest, in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>order, formed the main body. The interior of the palace
was old and unfrequented; a dark cloud filled it;
and it abounded with everything offensive to the senses.
The pillars were encrusted with ancient mould; the
walls teemed with loathsome slime; the roof was formed
of spears; the floor was covered with serpents, and filth
of every kind; so that the strangers were not a little
terrified. Above all, their noses were offended with the
fœtid smell. Farther on were iron seats, filled with
lifeless images of monstrous forms; and these were in
the recesses of the hall, separated from it by leaden
grates; and at the entrances were horrid porters, some
howling, and shaking their maces; some, with their goat-like
bodies, exhibiting an unseemly sport. Before the
adventurers proceeded farther into the interior, Thorkil
was careful to repeat his warning,—not to stretch forth
their hands to the treasures they would see. Passing
by a huge fragment of a rock, they perceived an aged
man reclining, with wounded body, on the sharp rocky
peaks above them. Beside him were three females, their
bodies covered with tumors, and, as if unable to
sit, reclined on the same couch. Who and what were
these? Thorkil, who was well versed in such matters,
informed his companions that the god Thor, offended
by the insolence of Geruth, had driven his bolt through
the heart of the giant; that the awful instrument had
penetrated into and riven the mountain; that the females
had been touched by it; and though their bodies
were unbroken, they were suffering the punishment
due to those who insulted the god. Proceeding forward,
they perceived seven large vessels, surrounded
with golden hoops, and filled with precious liquor.
Near them was a tooth of an unknown sea monster,
the extremities adorned with gold. Close by it
was a large horn inlaid with shining gems, and of
exquisite workmanship. Near this was a golden
bracelet of great weight. The temptation to seize
these valuable treasures was too great to be resisted.
One man, ignorant that the shining metal concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>destruction beneath it, stretched out his hand to the
bracelet. Another, influenced, also, by avarice, laid
his eager hands on the horn. A third, emboldened
by their example, placed the huge tooth on his
shoulders. They soon found how fatally they had
been deluded. One of these treasures was immediately
transformed into a serpent, which, with venomous tooth,
fell upon the robber. The horn became a dragon,
which, also, destroyed the spoiler. The tooth became
a sword, which found its way to the heart of the bearer.
Terrified at this spectacle, even the innocent began to
fear that they should suffer with the guilty. Proceeding
onwards, a door opened to a smaller recess, but
rich in treasures. Here were weapons, too large indeed
for the human body, but of inestimable value.
Among them was a royal mantle or cloak, with a cap,
and a belt of admirable workmanship. At the sight,
Thorkil, who had so often advised others, forgot himself.
He took the garment in his hand, and the rest,
influenced by his example, seized the things which they
most coveted. Suddenly the cavern, from its lowest
foundations, shook; every thing began to reel; and
the women cried aloud that these wicked robbers must
no longer be spared. Lifeless as they had appeared,
and more like statues than women, they suddenly found
a voice, and, rising from their couch, advanced against
the strangers. The rest of the monstrous shapes began
to howl in a most hideous manner. Broder and Buchi
were not unmindful of their former pursuits: with
their lances, they resisted the advancing genii; from
their bows and their slings they sent the sharp missiles
into the dense ranks of the monsters, and dispersed or
overthrew them. Yet twenty only of the royal party
survived; the rest were torn to pieces by the monsters.
In great consternation the survivors issued from the
cavern, returned to the river, were ferried over by
Guthmund, and entertained in the same manner as before.
On this occasion all abstained from the viands
and the ladies save Buchi, he who had hitherto been an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>example of moderation, and to whose valour in the
caverned palace so many were indebted for their lives.
Having taken one of the ladies to his bed, he was
seized with a sudden dizziness, and lost the memory of
the past. He did not, however, forget his human
feeling; for, anxious to show attention to the guests—now
strangers to him—he followed them in
one of the chariots of Guthmund, and was for ever
engulfed in the waters of the river. The king, pitying
the infatuation of his subjects, embarked and returned
towards Halogia. But the voyage was again a
troubled one: the men were exhausted by the fury of
the tempests and by hunger; and Gorm resolved on
sacrificing to the gods. While some of his crew called
on this, some on that divinity, he invoked the awful
Ugarthiloc, by whose favour he obtained a prosperous
navigation homewards.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>On the return of Thorkil, great as had been his services
to his companions in the enterprise, he could not
escape the malice of evil tongues. They said that he
had offended Ugarthiloc, whose vengeance must be
averted by supplication, and that Thorkil should, for
this purpose, be sent to the distant, mysterious shrine
of that deity. He insisted that his accusers should be
the companions of his voyage; and his request was
granted by the king. The vessels were prepared as
before, and the expedition sailed. At length they
reached a region where there was no sun, no moon, no stars,
where eternal night spread her sceptre over this unknown
deep. Fuel was the first thing of which they
felt the want, and they were compelled to subsist on
raw meat. Some of them caught the plague from food
so indigestible; the disease began in the stomach, and
soon descended to the vitals. To abstain was just as
fatal as to eat; and languor crept on those whom sickness
spared. At this moment, when despair had seized
on all, a light was seen at a distance. This inspired all
with hope, with new strength. They soon anchored;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and before going on shore, Thorkil placed a shining
carbuncle on the summit of the mast to direct them on
their return to the vessels. A cavern, with a low
narrow entrance, was before them. Leaving his companions
outside, Thorkil went in, and perceived two
gigantic eagles (or giants under the form of eagles<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a>),
with hard hooked beaks, placing wood on the fire. The
rugged entrance, the stinking threshold, the black wall,
the filthy roof, the floor covered with serpents, were
not more offensive to the eye than to the mind. One
of the giants, saluting him, told him that he had ventured
on a bold and most difficult undertaking,—that
of visiting the abode of a divinity little worshipped,
and of exploring regions beyond the sphere of the
world. “But,” added the giant, “I am acquainted
with the course which you will have to follow, and if
you will give me three good proverbs in as many sentences,
I will indicate it to you.” Thorkil did so to the
satisfaction of the giant. “You have yet a four days’
sail before you,” said the latter, “with hard rowing,
before you can reach the place you seek; there you
may find Ugarthiloc in his foul and gloomy cave.”
Thorkil was staggered at the labour before him; but he
had gone too far to recede, and he advanced to the fire
to take some of the flaming brands. He was compelled,
before he could obtain them, to deliver three
more proverbs.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><sup>[87]</sup></a> With his companions he then returned
to the ships; and a favourable breeze arising, they
reached the destined port on the fourth day. Here
they landed, and by means of a lurid twilight, were
enabled to have some glimpse of the objects around them.
Before them was a huge rock. With their flints they
struck a light, and made a fire at the entrance of the
cave,—a safeguard against the power of demons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Then, with lighted torches borne before them, Thorkil
and some of his companions entered the narrow opening,
and perceived a great number of iron seats surrounded
by serpents. Onward was a stream which
gently flowed over a sandy bottom: this being crossed,
the path declined a little, when a dark and obscure
cave was before them. There sat Ugarthiloc, his
hands and feet laden with a vast weight of fetters:
and the hairs of his head and beard were long and hard
as so many lances. That there might be some evidence
of the wonders he had seen, Thorkil, with the assistance
of his companions, plucked one hair from the chin
of the divinity; when such a stench issued from the
part, that had they not speedily applied their mantles
to their noses, they would have been unable to breathe.
As they issued from this awful cave, the snakes, flying
about them, spued venom upon them. With great
difficulty five only reached the ship, the rest falling
victims to the venom; and of these five, who were
pursued by the serpents, one lost his head, another his
eye-sight, a third his hand, through a fatal curiosity
to inspect these vengeful creatures. All would have
perished had not the hatches been closed by the thick
ox-skins, which bade defiance to the power of the venom.
Seeing how vain the attempt to propitiate these divinities,
Thorkil addressed his prayers to the God of all, by
whose favour a prosperous navigation brought him to
his own country.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Legends like the foregoing, which illustrate the
opinions of mankind, are not to be rejected as childish.
Wild as they are, they had once their believers,—and
believers, for anything we know, they may have at this
day, among the remote Lapps and Finns. Whether
the inventors, who were probably priests of Thor or
Odin, took this method of unfolding to their disciples
some physical theory, we shall not inquire. The darkness
which, as all men knew, overhung the polar sea during
half the year, favoured the diffusion of such stories.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>But what will most have struck the reader, in the first
of these legends, is, the similarity of some of its passages
with those of the Odyssey and other classical productions.
Many of the adventures in the second legend
are to be found in the Edda, but ascribed to another
individual. As Saxo could not borrow from the compilation
of either Saemund or Snorro, all three must
have drawn from some common source, and that source
was tradition. But we have dwelt long enough on
these fabulous times, and we must hasten to the historical.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>If any faith can be placed in Saxo’s relation, which
we see no reason to doubt, Gorm must have been contemporary
with the first of the Carlovingian kings; for
the historian expressly assures us that in this reign
Denmark was christianised. And in that of <i>Godric</i>
his son, who is also called <i>Godfrey</i>, we are told that
Charlemagne was subduing the Saxons. On referring,
indeed, to the list which we have given at the
beginning of this chapter, and which the best Danish
critics regard as approximating nearer to the truth than
any other yet constructed<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a>, the reader will perceive that
there is no mention of Gorm or Godric. But here we
must repeat what we have already frequently observed,
that both might have reigned in Jutland, while
Sigurd Ring and Ragnar Lodbrok and Sigurd Snogoje
reigned in Zealand. And even if this were not so,
we are by no means sure that the Icelandic authorities,
which alone have weight with the modern historians
of Denmark, ought to be followed to the utter
exclusion of Saxo, who lived as near to the period
as any of the former, and whose means of information
must have been of easier access. Strange that
in the eighth century—nay, even in the ninth—we
should find so much darkness, so much contradiction
in the history of a country which was now beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to occupy the attention of the Frank historians!
Yet such is the fact. “C’est un vrai labyrinthe,” says
Mallet, “où l’on se perd dans les contradictions et les
ténèbres.” The conjecture, however, which we have
made, viz., that Godric or Godfrey might reign in one
part of Denmark, while Sigurd Ring and Ragnar reigned
in another, acquires some confirmation from the fact
that the former, as rex Danorum in 803, is expressly
mentioned by Ado of Vienne. And in the Saga of
Olaf Trygveson, king of Norway, we read that this very
Godfrey reigned in Jutland during the time of Charlemagne.
Was he, the Jutish king, or Sigurd and
Ragnar, who appear to have reigned in Zealand, the true
sovereign of the Danes? Was one subject to the
other, or were both independent? This question no
man can answer. The passage, however, of Ado, confirmed
as it is by that in Olaf Trygveson’s Saga, explains
the confusion which we find at every step in the
Danish history prior to the latter part of the tenth
century. We may add that, according to the same
authority, Godfrey being slain by his own subjects on
his return from a successful expedition to Frisia, Hemming,
his brother or nephew, succeeded. Now these
facts are confirmed by Saxo; and where both Icelandic
and Danish authorities concur, and are confirmed by
the Frank historians (and Hemming’s accession, no less
than Godfrey’s death, is mentioned by several), we see
no ground for scepticism. These princes, then, must
be admitted; and for the reasons already given they
may be admitted, without excluding Sigurd Ring, or
Ragnar Lodbrog, or Sigurd Snogoje.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The age of <i>Ragnar</i> ought to be an historic age; but
his reign is so pervaded by fable, that we can make
nothing of it. Many have been the attempts to reconcile
his chronology, at least as found in northern writers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>with that of the Frankish and Anglo-Saxon historians;
but neither it, nor the actions recorded of him by both,
can possibly be reconciled. Critics, therefore, have been
driven to the inference that there were two Ragnars,—one
of the eighth, the other of the ninth century; and,
probably, this conjecture is the true one. In the latter
century, indeed, we read of a Jutland chief named
Ragenfred, or Regnier, who, being exiled by the reigning
king of Denmark, became a pirate, and committed
dreadful depredations on the coasts of Britain
and Ireland. Very probably the actions of both—and
both, no doubt, were extraordinary men—have been
confounded together, and enabled Saxo to incorporate,
into one relation, the romantic incidents which tradition
had preserved of both. As we have indulged so largely
in the romantic, we will not, on this occasion, translate
that venerable authority. And it is scarcely necessary
to allude to this hero’s death, which, as everybody
knows, happened in Northumberland. Defeated by
Ella, the Saxon king of the province, and thrown into
a dungeon full of serpents, he expired, insensible of his
torments. It is said, indeed, that he composed a lay
enumerating his former exploits, and his conviction that
his sons would revenge his death; but the story, and
the ode itself, are so improbable, that they must be
consigned to the domain of poetic invention, and no
longer be allowed to grow in that of history. Whether
there be much truth in the subsequent part of this story,
viz., that the sons of Ragnar did hasten to revenge him,
that they disembarked on the Northumbrian coast, defeated
the Anglo-Saxons near York, and transformed
the province from a Saxon into a Danish state, we are
unable to decide with anything approaching to confidence.
The probability, however, is, that, notwithstanding
the silence of the Saxon Chronicle on this
subject, there is some foundation for the account. So
constantly do the ancient writers—writers, too, at no
great distance from the period—speak of Danish viceroys,
often with the regal title, being sent to Northumbria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>that we are unwilling to consider the narrative
as the pure invention of the Scalds.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>794
to
935.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the death of Ragnar, the sceptre of at least a
portion of Denmark—perhaps Scania and the isles—passed
into the hands of <i>Sigurd II.</i> (or <i>Siward</i><a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a>),
surnamed <i>Snogoje</i>, or Snake-eyed. At the same time,
Jutland was possessed by other kings, whether as tributaries,
or independent, there would be rashness in
deciding. We read, indeed, that <i>Hemming</i> was contemporary
with him; that <i>Harald</i> succeeded Hemming in
some part of Jutland; that this latter prince was exiled
through an insurrection of the sons of Godric, or Godfrey,
who fought for the inheritance of their father;
that this Harald became a Christian, and sought the
protection of Louis le Debonnaire; that the Carlovingian
monarch assisted him to return triumphant; but
that, about the year 828, being again deprived of his
throne, he passed his days in religious contemplation.
His name will always be memorable for his solemn baptism
at Ingleheim, in presence of the emperor’s court;
and for his efforts to introduce Christianity into Jutland.
Under his auspices St. Anscar, the apostle of Scandinavia,
penetrated into Jutland; and though the labours
of this pious missionary, owing to the troubles of the
country, were attended with little success, the merit of
this first Christian prince of Denmark is not the less.
It was, indeed, his attachment to the new religion which,
more than any other cause, led to his failure. Sigurd, the
other Danish king, had no wish to imitate the example
of Harald; but he is celebrated as a peaceful, good, and
enlightened ruler. For this reason, his reign affords no
materials for history. On his death, in 803, he was succeeded,
say the Icelandic chroniclers, by <i>Harda Canute</i>,
his son; but, according to Saxo, by his son <i>Eric I.</i> How
shall we decide? We can only conjecture that both princes
reigned, at the same time, over different parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>monarchy; but that Eric died early, while Harda Canute
survived to the middle of the ninth century. By the
same hypothesis only can we reconcile the names of the
kings who succeeded Eric and Harda Canute. By referring
to the list at the head of this chapter<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a>, the
reader will perceive that it allows of only two sovereigns
between Eric I. and Harold Blaatand,—king <i>Eric II.</i>
and <i>Gorm the Old</i>; while Saxo admits five, viz., <i>Canute
the Little</i>, <i>Frode VI.</i>, <i>Gorm Anglicus</i> (so called from his
birthplace), <i>Harold V.</i>, and <i>Gorm the Old</i>; thus rejecting
Eric II., and adding four others. To us, the
mode of reconciliation appears simple. While Eric II.
and Gorm ruled over the islands and Scania, the
other princes mentioned by Saxo reigned in another
part of Jutland. This hypothesis is confirmed by
one important fact,—that the life of Gorm was unusually
protracted; and that, by conquest or negotiation,
by open force or cunning, he obtained the government
of all the states now comprising the Danish monarchy.
Seeing the conduct of the Jutland princes, their civil wars,
their consequent weakness and unpopularity, he fell
on them, and put an end to their stormy independence.
Over the reign of Gorm, indeed, there hangs much
obscurity, which the researches of northern critics have
by no means dissipated. That he performed many great
actions; that, in a few years, he conquered Jutland;
that he humbled the Saxons, and made some temporary
accessions to his states on the side of Mecklenburg and
Pomerania; appear to be undoubted facts. The Frankish
writers, however, affirm that he was defeated by
Henry the Fowler, his newly incorporated monarchy
conquered as far as Sleswic, a margrave established in
that place, and he himself compelled to admit the missionaries
of Christianity into his states. Against this
statement, which principally depends on the authority
of Adam of Bremen, the native historians of Denmark
make a stand; they will not allow that their country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>or any portion of it, was ever thus subdued. But what
counter authority can they oppose to this? Where are
their native writers, if not contemporary, at least as
near to the period as Adam, to contradict this relation?
They have no such writers; they have nothing in the
shape of authority before the close of the twelfth century:
for the materials of their history, they must recur
to the very writers whom they would thus undervalue.
The statement of Adam, a canon of Bremen, who during
so long a period collected materials for his ecclesiastical
history, is too minute, too reasonable, too well confirmed
by allusions, however incidental, in other writers (especially
in the biographers of a few saints), to leave room
for scepticism on the subject. Nor does this detract, in
the least degree, from the merit of Gorm. By incorporating
into one compact monarchy insignificant states,
which had so often refused even a nominal obedience to
the kings of Ledra, or Jutland, and by destroying so
many piratical chiefs, whose arms were turned now
against one another, now against their royal superiors,
he effected more good than any preceding king of Denmark.
This is his true glory. In another respect, he
is less deserving of our praise;—he was hostile to the
diffusion of Christianity. Yet he had married a Christian
lady, whose beauty and virtues were the theme of
admiration, and who certainly had considerable influence
over him. While persecuting the missionaries in the
rest of his states, he appears to have allowed her the
exercise of her religion,—her chapel and priests. Some
writers assert that, though he did not like, he never
seriously opposed, the preaching of Christianity in any
part of his states; and, in confirmation of this statement,
they assert that he allowed his sons, Canute and
Harald, to be baptized, and Jutland, at least, to make
daily progress in the new faith. Yet Saxo assures us
that he demolished the churches which had been erected
in the preceding reign; that he restored the pagan
temples; that he put to death, or exiled, the teachers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Christianity. This testimony is too positive to be evaded.
But, though always a bigoted pagan, he might have
been more intolerant at one period of life than another:
probably he was a fierce persecutor until his marriage,
and the virtues of his queen had mitigated his hatred
of Christianity, and, by degrees, induced him to tolerate
it. Though he might have allowed his sons to be baptized,
he took care that their habits should be pagan.
They were the most noted pirates of the age, and he
rejoiced in their success. One of them, however, was
killed near Dublin, and the blow is said to have proved
fatal to him. He died, says Adam of Bremen, in
935; probably, however, he resigned his power in that
year, and survived six years longer.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>935
to
964.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Harald II.</span> surnamed <i>Blaatand</i>, or Blue-tooth,
seems, during the last six years of his father’s life, to
have been either associated in the government with that
king, or to have ruled as his deputy. In 941, however,
on the death of Gorm, he was the undisputed heir of
the monarchy. The early part of his reign was most
brilliant; the latter disastrous. Soon after his accession,
his aid was implored by his countrymen in Normandy.
Most readers are aware that, in the latter half
of the preceding century, Rollo, assisted by perpetual
reinforcements from the north, had wrested that province
from the kings of France, and, in 912, on his
baptism, had been declared the lawful duke of his new
conquest. In 927, the veteran warrior, exhausted by
age and fatigue, had resigned the dignity to his son
William Longsword. In 943, this duke was assassinated,
and his son Richard, a child, was left exposed
to the hostilities of Louis d’Outremer, who naturally
wished to recover that fine province, and confide the
government to a French, not to a Norman, vassal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Louis led an army into Normandy, defeated the troops
which the regency opposed to him, and obtained possession
of the young duke’s person. In this emergency
the Normans applied for aid to Harald, whose warlike
actions were well known to them. In 944, that is, in
a year after duke William’s assassination, the Danish
king appeared off Cherburg, with a considerable armament.
Alarmed at the danger, Louis had recourse to
negotiation; and at the personal interview which followed,
the dispute would, in all probability, have been
amicably arranged, had not some chiefs of both armies
begun to quarrel. This quarrel led to a general engagement,
in which Louis was vanquished, and made
prisoner. To obtain his liberty, he was compelled to
release the young duke, whose right to the fief he also
recognised. This was a proud day for Harald, who
returned to Denmark with a reputation unrivalled in
the north. His next exploit was similar—to place
on the throne of Norway (now a monarchy) the
sons of Eric, whom Hako, the reigning king, had
driven into exile. His arms were successful; and he
restored to Harald Grafeld the sceptre of the father.
Twelve years afterwards, this prince being assassinated
(an event of very usual occurrence in the history of the
north), the Danish king went a second time into Norway,
subdued the country, and divided it into three
kingdoms. One portion he confided, under the ordinary
feudal obligations, to Harald Grenshi, a prince of the
family; a second, subject to the same homage and
service, was bestowed on jarl Hako; the third, which
was the lion’s share, was reserved to the Danish crown;
and from all a large annual tribute was exacted. This
policy was injurious enough to Norway, however useful
it might be to Denmark. And it was scarcely less
hurtful to England, since it augmented the power of
the Danish kings, so as to render them formidable
enemies to this island. In his next expedition, which
was against no less a personage than the emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Otho I., he was less happy. Embracing the cause of a
rebel whom Otho had placed under the ban of the
empire, and learning that the monarch was absent in
Italy, he made a fierce irruption into Saxony, and, we
are told, put to death the ambassadors of Otho. He
had little difficulty in driving the imperial garrison from
Sleswic, and in destroying that important fortress. On
the return of Otho, however, who lost no time in
avenging the indignity offered to the empire, Holstein
was speedily overrun, and he driven into the north of
Jutland. He was compelled to treat with the victor;
and his states were left him on the condition of his
baptism, and that of his son Sweyn, and of helping,
instead of impeding, the progress of Christianity in his
dominions. That on this occasion he did homage for
them to the emperor, is asserted by the German, and
denied by most native, historians. The subject may
occupy our attention for a few moments.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>964.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>That Harald did homage to Otho for the whole of
Denmark,—that country being subdued and rendered
tributary by the latter,—is expressly asserted by Sweyn
Aggesen, a Danish writer of the twelfth century.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a> It
is equally affirmed by Adam of Bremen, who wrote
within half a century of Harald’s death, and who is
better acquainted with the transactions of Holstein and
Jutland than all the writers of his age.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a> And it is
inferred, from a privilege granted by Otho to the church
of Hamburg, exempting the lands of three bishoprics
just created in Denmark—Aarhuus, Sleswic, Rypen—from
all contributions to the state, from all dependence
on the secular government; and extending the same
privilege to all the lands which those churches might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>hereafter possess throughout Denmark. To weaken the
effect of these testimonies has been the object of native
writers. But what are their reasons? Too feeble to
have any weight out of Denmark. They insist that
Sweyn was misled by the authority of Adam of Bremen;
that Adam, himself, was an ignorant ecclesiastic, who
readily assented to whatever Otho assumed; and that
the privilege in question, of which the authenticity
cannot be denied, is of no weight,—a pure formula of the
imperial chancellor, dictated, indeed, by an ambitious,
all-grasping court, but founded on no real conquest,
much less vassalage. To answer such objections would
be an insult to the reader’s understanding. There can
be no doubt of the emperor’s feudal supremacy over
Denmark, any more than over Bohemia, or Poland, or
Lombardy. It has, indeed, been contended that if Otho
had a spiritual, he had no temporal jurisdiction; that
he might be the protector, the superintendent, the head
of the rising church, without having the least authority
over the state. But this allegation is at variance with
all reason and with all history. Would a sovereign
have the insane effrontery to say what lands shall, and
what shall not, pay taxes, unless he had some authority
over them? Would he exempt them from
contributing towards the support of the crown, unless
that crown were in some degree dependent on
him? And where is there any example of such unlicensed
interference? But we all know that vassalitic
obligations were of various kinds, some oppressive
enough, others little more than nominal; and we may
admit that though Harald was compelled to do homage,
and even to pay a yearly tribute, he remained independent
so far as his internal administration was concerned.
It was the policy of Otho to christianise the
kingdom—to transform restless barbarians into civilised
creatures—to humanise the fiercest of pagans by
the influence of a mild and powerful religion. Without
such a change, he saw no security for his northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>frontier. But in striving to attain this object, great
moderation was necessary: he did not wish to exasperate,
where his interest was so obviously to induce
the most friendly relations; still less would he, by severe
exactions,—exactions, however, which his position
as conqueror might have enabled him to enforce,—indispose
the minds of a high-spirited prince and a
warlike people, against the faith which he wished them
to embrace.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>964.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But miracles were no longer wrought in the time of
the Othos. If Harald and some of his people outwardly
conformed to the religion of Christ, they were
still influenced by that of Odin. Besides, to both the
national independence was dear; and we cannot be
surprised at the hostile feeling with which the Danes
regarded the Germans. During the life of the first
Otho, indeed, there was outward harmony; but in about
a year after the accession of the second (974), he joined
the party of Henry duke of Bavaria, then a rebel, and
made several irruptions into Saxony. On the defeat of
that powerful vassal, Otho penetrated into Jutland, and
advanced as far as the Sound which bears his name.
With the result of this war we are not acquainted; but
probably Harald submitted. The events, however, of
both wars, which have been frequently confounded into
one, are very doubtful. A more certain fact is, that
the good fortune of Harald now forsook him. He
failed in an expedition against Norway, which had
thrown off its vassalage. Nor was this the worst: his
son Sweyn, who had been baptized with him, rebelled
against him. The motives which led the prince in this
undutiful conduct are unknown. Probably the chief
was the desire of power; and as his nature was ferocious,
he scrupled not to bear arms against his father.
There is also some reason to believe that he was the
instrument of a great party,—the old pagans, who could
not behold with much pleasure the gradual progress of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the new faith, and the consequent decline of their own.
<i>His</i> conversion was not, like his father’s, very sincere;
or, perhaps, he cared not for either religion, so that his
ambition was gratified. As the pagans were still the
more numerous subjects of the state, he became at
once their patron and their tool. The war was short,
and Harald was compelled to flee. He sought a refuge
in Normandy, and by duke Richard, we are told, was
restored to at least a portion of his dominions. How
far this relation is true, we cannot, in the absence of
contemporary authority, decide. A more certain fact
is, that, in 991, he was assassinated by the procurement
of his own son. He was walking on the skirts of a
wood, when an arrow from the bow of a Jomsberg
pirate belonging to a band in the pay of Sweyn, laid
him in the dust.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the fate of a monarch whose memory was
dear to the early Christians of Denmark. He was the
first monarch that openly professed the new religion;
and the constancy with which he adhered to it affords
indisputable proof of his sincerity. From Ledra, the
ancient seat of the Odinic superstition, he removed his
court to Roskild, where he erected a cathedral to the
most holy Trinity. This was a politic step; connected
with the new capital were no ancient recollections to
remind the idolater of the faith of his fathers. The
foundation of three other bishoprics attested his zeal.
The reverence in which this monarch was held in the
centuries immediately following his death, and a passage,
of which the application was mistaken, in the
History of Adam of Bremen, nearly led to his canonisation.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>991.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the tragical death of Harald, the sceptre devolved
to the unnatural <i>Sweyn</i>. As the majority of the people
were still pagans, the accession of this prince was beheld
with satisfaction; for though, perhaps, he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>openly apostatise, he encouraged the old religion, and
rebuilt many of the temples which had been destroyed.
And he was the ally of the Jomsburg pirates, the leader
of whom shot the arrow which had proved fatal to
Harald. Yet Harald was the founder of that city,—one
of the most famous in the annals of the world.
It was situated near the great lake of Pomerania, on the
site of the modern Wollin. It was avowedly built for
a piratical fortress; yet the founders could not anticipate
the greatness which it afterwards retained. Its
first governor, who was also its legislator, was a pirate
chief, Palnatoko, whose skill as an archer was never
equalled in the north. He decreed that no man who
had ever shown the slightest fear, even in the greatest
dangers, should be a member of the new community.
No Christian was admitted, because Christianity was
supposed to enfeeble the mind; but people of all other
religions and of all countries were received; and each
of the great European nations had a street of its own.
It was the last place of the north which was humanised
by the religion of Christ; and probably it would longer
have defied the general influence of that faith, had not
its riches enervated the vigour of its inhabitants, and
intestine dissensions still further weakened it, so as to
render it a prey to its enemies. Palnatoko, the assassin
of Harald, had been long resident at the Danish
court, and had been the tutor of Sweyn; and to that
barbarous deed he was, we are told, excited by a personal
injury. His skill in archery was the quality on
which he most prided himself, and he was accustomed
to boast that he could hit an apple, however small, on
the top of a pole. This boast, which was regarded as
an arrogant display, made him some enemies. It
reached Harald, who insisted that the archer’s own
child should supply the place of the pole; and threatened,
that if the first arrow missed its aim, his own
head should bear the penalty. As there was no
hope of changing the royal determination, Palnatoko
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>warned his child to be steady—not to flinch hand or
foot—not to move a muscle of his body, when the arrow
approached. On the day appointed, the dreaded experiment
was tried; and the apple was cloven, while the
child remained uninjured. But the archer had three
arrows, and being asked what he had intended to do
with the remaining two, he replied, that had he been the
death of innocence, the guilty contriver of the experiment
should not have escaped.—Such is the story
which Saxo has preserved. That it has given rise to
the fabulous one of William Tell, must be apparent to
the reader; for the Danish historian wrote a full century
before the Swiss patriot flourished. Nor do we
think that Saxo’s account is the original one: the circumstance
probably took place centuries before the
reign of Harald Blaatand, and became a portion of the
“legendary lore” the origin of which is so mysterious.
Whether this incident be true or false in regard to
Harald and this archer, the latter joined Sweyn, and,
as we have already related, caused the death of the
former.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>991.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In the early part of this monarch’s reign we meet
with much obscurity, much contradiction. We are told
that in return for his rebellion against his father, and
for his restoration of paganism, he was doomed to great
bitterness of suffering; that he was thrice a prisoner
among the pirates, and thrice redeemed by his people.
For the last act of redemption he is said to have been
indebted to Danish ladies, who, seeing that the money
of the state was wholly exhausted by the preceding
ransoms, contributed their choicest ornaments for that
purpose. For this generosity, adds Saxo, the grateful
Sweyn passed a law, that, in future, females should, like
males, succeed, by inheritance, to a portion of their
father’s property. Such a law certainly existed, and it
may possibly be referred to Sweyn; but in regard to
the circumstances which gave rise to it, there is room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>for scepticism. That a powerful monarch—for such
Sweyn always was—should be <i>thrice</i> captured by
pirates,—the pirates, too, of Jomsberg,—is surely unparalleled
in the history of the world. Yet the relation
alike of Saxo and Sweyn Aggesen must have had some
foundation in truth. The probability is, that the king,
<i>prior to his accession</i>, was <i>once</i> a captive, and that the
monastic writers of the following age mistook the time
and multiplied the circumstances.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Those venerable
fathers, struck with horror at the filial no less than the
religious impiety of this king, were ready to adopt,
without examination, the most unfavourable reports
concerning him. Another statement, that Sweyn
was expelled from his kingdom by Eric of Sweden,
and that he remained almost fifteen years in exile,
fourteen of which he spent in Scotland, is entitled
to just the same credit. His father, we are told,
died in 991; yet in 994 he was powerful enough to
begin the conquest of England; and from that year to
the period of his death, in 1014, he was always in this
country, or in Denmark. Where, then, are these sixteen
years to be inserted? Assuredly no chasm can be found
for them between 991 and 1014. Other circumstances
demonstrate the falsehood of the relation,—a relation,
however, adopted by the most recent historians. On
his expulsion, we are told, he applied for the common
rights of hospitality to Olaf Trygveson of Norway, but
was spurned by that prince. This conduct of Olaf,
says Saxo, was the less justifiable, as Sweyn had assisted
him to regain the throne of Norway. Let us for a
moment attend to dates. Sweyn’s restoration to his
country, after his fifteen years of exile, is placed in the
year 994; and as Olaf was the first monarch to whom
he applied, this application must have been made about
979. But Olaf did not return to Norway before 996.
How much earlier than this year must he have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>assisted by Sweyn? Yet for this, as for the preceding
relation, there was probably some basis. If Sweyn ever
was in exile,—and there is some reason to infer that
he was, during his hostility with his father,—that exile
was before the death of Harald, and consequently before
his accession to the monarchy. It may possibly be
that he was at one time prior to that event king of
some portion of the monarchy,—perhaps of Scania;
and this conjecture would at once account for the facility
with which Eric expelled him. However this be,
there can be no doubt that if this banishment be a fact,
it must be referred to a period long prior to 991. What
confirms this conjecture is, the statement of Saxo, that
the monarch to whom Sweyn next applied was
Edward king of England. This was evidently Edward
the Martyr, who ascended the throne in 975, and was
assassinated in 978,—a period which will exactly
agree with the duration assigned to his exile.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>991
to
993.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>All writers allow that Sweyn, soon after his accession,
sent or led an armament against Hako, the usurper of
Norway. Snorro assures us that this expedition was
planned by the Jomsberg pirates, who were invited to
celebrate the funeral solemnities of Harald (that is, to
get drunk) at the court of Sweyn; and he adds that
the same vow was taken in regard to England. The
vows of drunken men are not usually remembered; but
these pirates remembered theirs but too well. With
sixty vessels, filled by the bravest heroes of the republic,
they hastened to the Norwegian coast; there they separated,
and were separately assailed by jarl Hako, his
son, and other chiefs of the kingdom. But, desperate
as was the valour of the pirates, their numbers were too
few, in comparison with those of the enemy, to fulfil
their oath of taking Harald alive, or expelling him from
Norway. They were signally defeated, though not until
prodigies of valour had been effected by them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>contempt in which they beheld death is horribly illustrated
by Snorro. Thirty of them being captured, their
feet were tied by a rope, and they were carried on shore.
They were placed on benches, in a right line, each near
to the other, awaiting their death. Thorkil, a Norwegian
jarl, advanced with a huge sword, and anticipated
much pleasure from the exercise of killing them
in detail. Accosting the chief of them, he said, “So,
Vagne, thou madest a vow to put me to death; but it
seems more likely that I shall have the honour of sending
thee with my apology.” The pirate looked at him
with much contempt. Beginning at the end of the line,
he struck off the heads of many in succession, who
faithfully observed the condition of their order,—never
to exhibit the shadow of a fear. One desired the jarl
to strike him in the forehead, and to look whether he
should so much as blink his eyes. The next victim held
in his hand the backbone of a fish. “I will wager
thee,” he said to Thorkil, “that, after my head is off,
I shall be able to plunge this bone into the ground!”
But the boast was vain: when his head left his body,
the bone fell from his hand. “Injure not my hair!”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
cried another, as he stretched out his neck to receive
the blow. An attendant held the long tresses with
both hands, while the executioner struck; but, at the
moment, the pirate threw back his head, and the sword
amputated the two hands of the courtier, without injuring
the pirate. Great was the triumph of the latter;
and Eric, the son of Hako, admiring his intrepidity,
procured his pardon. Another, Vagne, one of the chiefs,
was pushed against the executioner by his next fellow;
Thorkil fell, and, in so doing, his sword cut the rope
which bound the pirate, who, seizing the weapon, beheaded
the Norwegian jarl. Eric, too, procured <i>his</i>
pardon. Eighteen being in this manner slain, the visitors
began to feel some admiration for the rest. “Wilt
thou accept the offer of thy life?” was demanded of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>next. “That,” replied the man, who would not receive
even life from an ignoble hand, “depends on the
dignity of the giver!” Jarl Eric, the son of Hako,
was named, and the offer was accepted. “Wilt thou?”
was addressed to another. “Not unless my companions
are spared also!” was the reply; and they were
spared.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>991

<p class='c009'>If the expedition against Norway thus failed, very
different was the issue of that directed against England.
During the greater part of a century, this island had
been unmolested by the pirates. Alfred, towards the
close of his reign, had humbled them; Edward the
elder had signally triumphed over them; and the name
of Athelstane had been dreaded by all the rovers of the
sea. There had been battles, indeed, with the Danish
state of Northumberland, which, prior to Athelstane’s
reign, had formed no part of the Saxon confederation;
but the coasts of central and northern England had been
undisturbed. On the accession of Ethelred, however,
the scourge was resumed. In 991, a large force appeared
before Ipswich, and marched to Malden, laying
waste the country on every side. On this occasion
Brithnoth, the Saxon governor of Essex, was slain; and
his fate has been related in a poem, from which copious
extracts may be found in a volume connected with the
present.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a> These formidable invaders, as every child
knows, were bribed to leave England; and, as every
child knows, they soon returned in greater numbers than
before. Even when steel, instead of gold, was to be the
tribute, a cowardly and treacherous commander, Alfric
of Mercia, was intrusted with the defence of England.
In the following years, every province was desolated.
In 994, Sweyn himself appeared in the Thames with a
formidable fleet. He had an ally, Olaf, the son of
Trygve, who, since infancy, had never been in Norway,
and whose piratical exploits had been celebrated from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Russia to Ireland.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a> His attack on London was repelled;
but Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire suffered
dreadfully from his depredations, and those of his
ally. As before, though the number of pirates did
not exceed 10,000, money was offered by the despicable
Ethelred. Olaf, on receiving it, visited the court of the
Saxon king, received the rite of confirmation (he had
previously been baptized in one of the Scilly islands),
and promised never again to molest the English coast.
We hear no more of his depredations: but whether
his forbearance was owing to his promise, or to his departure
for Norway, the throne of which he ascended
in little more than a year from this period, may well be
doubted.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a> But Sweyn had no such moderation. In
about three years from the payment of the 16,000<i>l.</i>,
he appeared in the south-west counties, advanced into
Sussex and Hampshire, laying waste everything in his
passage, and wintered as securely as if he had been naturalised:
no opposition was made to his progress. Kent
was next ravaged; and the whole of England would,
no doubt, have become Danish, had not Sweyn been
recalled to contend with a more formidable enemy, Olaf
of Norway. One year after the death of that monarch<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a>,
that is, in 1001, the Danes returned to a country where
they had found no enemies, but abundance of prey.
Another heavy ransom, and extensive estates in different
parts of the kingdom, procured a temporary cessation of
hostilities.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1001
to
1003.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>If Ethelred could not oppose the enemy in the field,
and if his coffers were exhausted, he had still one
resource left,—that of a general massacre. The day
before the festival of St. Brice, the authorities of every
city and town received secret letters from the court,
commanding them and the people everywhere to rise at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a certain hour, to fall on the unarmed, unsuspicious
Danes, and not to spare one of them. The order was
too well obeyed, and the English nation made itself
equally guilty with its king. Many of the victims
were naturalised; many had English husbands or wives;
more were on terms of intimacy with the natives, and,
at the moment this bloody mandate was executed, were
sharing the hospitality of their huts. Nobody was
spared: decrepit age and helpless infancy, youth and
beauty, pleaded in vain. Even Gunhilda, sister of
Sweyn, a convert to Christianity and the wife of an
English earl, suffered with the rest; but not until she
had seen her husband and son beheaded in her presence.
This was not the mere act of the crown, nor that of
a few courtiers, nor that of the municipal authorities:
it was that of the English nation. Retribution, as
Gunhilda had prophesied, was at hand; and every
reader will rejoice that it was so. Sweyn no sooner
heard of the massacre, than he swore never to rest until
he had inflicted a terrible vengeance on the people.
He no longer wished for booty, merely: he would also
destroy. With a fleet of three hundred sail, he steered
to the west of the island, landed in Cornwall, commenced
his devastating career, reached Exeter, which
he took by assault, set it on fire, and massacred the inhabitants.
From thence he proceeded into Wiltshire,
where fire and sword did their work, and passed by way
of Salisbury to the sea coast, laden with plunder. No
attempt was made to arrest his destructive progress: a
Saxon force under Alfric had, indeed, assembled; but
it would not fight, and it retired covered with the
derision of the invaders.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1003
to
1009.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The winter of 1003 Sweyn passed in Denmark; in
the following year he was again in England. His
destructive career now commenced in the eastern counties;
but this year they terminated sooner than could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>have been foreseen. A famine—the result of preceding
depredations—afflicted the land; and as provisions
in sufficient abundance could not be found, the
pirates returned home for a season. The deplorable
cowardice of the troops, the imbecility of the governors,
from Ethelred down to the meanest thane, was never
equalled in any other country. This condition is well
described by Turketul in a letter to Sweyn:—“A
country illustrious and powerful; a king asleep, caring
only for women and wine, trembling at the very mention
of war, hated by his own people, despised by foreigners;
generals envious of one another; governors who fly at
the first shout of battle.” This weak and vicious king
had the felicity to convert his friends into enemies at
the very time he most needed their assistance. In 1002
he married the princess Emma of Normandy; but his
behaviour to her was so grossly offensive, so brutal, that
her father, duke Richard I., joined in making him still
more contemptible by imprisoning or killing his subjects
who happened to pass through Normandy. The pirates
of Sweyn soon returned to consummate their work. In
1006 a heavy sum was paid them; the following year
they demanded an equal sum, and declared that, in
future, it must be annually paid by way of tribute.
Some feeble efforts were made to defend the country;
but the leaders of the fleet which had been raised turned
their arms against one another. Thus fell the hopes
of the nation, which prepared its neck for the most galling
yoke that had ever afflicted it.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c017'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1010.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In the year 1010 the Danes were in possession of
sixteen English counties, and they exacted forty-eight
thousand pounds for sparing the rest. But such
moderation was not in their policy; and no sooner
was the money theirs, than their atrocities recommenced.
The condition of Kent—which was that
of half England—is more graphically described by the
biographer of St. Elphege, archbishop of Canterbury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>than by all the chronicles of the period. When that
city was first besieged, there was some prospect of a
defence; the walls were strong, and there were many
strong arms eager to defend their cathedral, their bishop,
their wives and children. But a traitor (and England was
full of them) set fire to about twenty different houses: to
extinguish the flames many of the defenders left their
posts; one of the gates was broken open, and the pirates
rushed into the city, while the flames spread on every
side. The men were cut down in the streets, or they
were thrown into the devouring fire; women were violated
and speared; children were tossed like balls from
the points of the lances. As a last resource, St. Elphege
and his clergy had taken refuge in the cathedral; but
he could not hear of these excesses without endeavouring
to stop them. Rushing from the sacred pile into the
midst of the pirates, he exclaimed, “Spare the city! at
least, if you are men, spare the helplessness of infancy!
Turn your weapons against me, only, who have always
condemned your crimes!” They gagged him, bound
him, and led him to witness the fate of his church, to
which thousands of the people had now resorted in the
vain hope that its sanctity would impress even pagans.
It was soon on fire; the smoke ascended in clouds; the
flames spread; and as the unfortunate people, forced
by the burning liquid lead, issued from the building,
they were cut down by the ferocious pirates. Of eight
thousand inhabitants, about a tenth of the number were
spared, in the hope of ransom; and such as were unable
or unwilling to pay it were put to a cruel death.
Among them was St. Elphege, who might have raised
the sum demanded for him—three thousand pieces of
gold—had he signed an order to the churches of his
diocese to pay the money from their treasuries. But he
refused to allow that which had been raised for the
poor to be expended on him: he would not, he said,
purchase life on terms so disgraceful. He who, throughout
life, had begged for the indigent, would not be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>means of plundering them in his old age. After being
detained for some time, kept in a loathsome dungeon,
starved, tormented, beaten, in the view of subduing his
inflexibility, he was martyred, his last ejaculations being
for his flock, his country, his very enemies.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c017'><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1013
to
1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In 1013 Sweyn arrived, with new reinforcements, to
take possession of the whole island. On landing in the
north, the earl of Northumberland and the whole province
submitted. Proceeding to the south, Oxford,
Winchester, Bath, with all the towns of the west, and
all the great thanes, sent in their allegiance. For some
time London held out, because Ethelred was in it; but
that doughty hero, having ascertained that duke Richard
of Normandy would receive him for the sake of his wife,
precipitately fled to Rouen, leaving his capital and
kingdom in the hands of the invaders. Sweyn was
king of England; and he used the title, though, owing to
the short residue of his life, he was not crowned. That
he exercised all the rights of sovereignty, fully as the
Saxon kings had ever done, is admitted by our own
historians. His reign is said to have been one of
severe exaction. He died at Gainsborough in one year
after his elevation, under circumstances of suspicion.
The northern annalists declare that he was killed by
prince Edward, afterwards the Confessor; but no English
authority confirms the report. This was not the
work of Edward; but it might be that of Edmund
Ironside.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Many years before his death Sweyn probably reverted
to Christianity, and persevered in it unto his death.
But whether pagan or Christian, he was a ferocious
warrior and a stern king. With natural talents of a
high order, with indomitable courage, with unwearied
activity, he obtained advantages which none of his predecessors
had enjoyed. We have already alluded to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>diversion which his son, with Olaf Trygveson, king of
Norway, created in favour of England. After the death
of that hero (1000), he seized a portion of Norway,
while the Swedish king seized another; and this augmentation
of his power no doubt rendered him more
able to conquer England.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Introduction to the present volume we have
added the tabular list of kings by archbishop Joannes
Magnus, as illustrative of the difficulty which must
accompany all researches into the ancient history of
Sweden.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a> The exploits of those kings, their chronological
order, their very names, rest under a deep cloud.
Where, indeed, no two authors agree,—where the
names, not merely of two or three sovereigns, but of
nearly one half, are as different as the actions ascribed
to them,—what can be inferred but this, that little dependence
is to be placed on any one of them? Compare,
for example, the list given by the archbishop
with that which modern Swedish critics approve<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a>; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>what must be the reader’s surprise to find—110 in the
former case, and 37 in the other; the names, too, for
the most part, dissimilar as the number! If we take
that given by the authors of our Universal History<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>we shall, indeed, have some approximation in respect to
the number, but little in regard to the names, of the
kings. Other lists might be produced equally contrasting
with the one contained in the Norwegian authorities.
Whence this diversity, which modern historians have
pronounced to be hopelessly irreconcileable? It arises
from a very simple cause. When the Swiones, the attendants
of Odin,—his companions from his Asiatic
kingdom,—arrived in the north, they found a Gothic
tribe, the Gothones, under Gylfo their king, seated
along the maritime coast, and extending to the centre
of Sweden. How long this tribe had been settled there
when the Swiones arrived would be vain to inquire.
By what means Odin and his followers obtained a
portion of the country, and established the seat of his
new empire at Upsal, has been already related. Here,
then, were two distinct tribes, the Gothones or Goths,
and the Swiones or Swedes, to say nothing of the original
tribes, or, at least, fragments of those tribes, who
had been located in these regions many centuries before
the arrival of the Goths. Now the kings whom
Joannes Magnus, Torfœus, Loccenius, the authors of
our Universal History, and other writers enumerate,
were the kings of the Goths and Swedes, while those
contained in the Landfedgatal, the Heimskringla, and
other Icelandic authorities, were sovereigns of the
Swedes only. That the two people, and, consequently, the
districts which they inhabited, were for many centuries
under distinct rulers, is one of the best ascertained facts
of history. The former called themselves kings of the
Goths, or of Gothland, only; the latter, now kings of
the Swedes, now of Upsal. This distinction was not
only observed from the very dawn of their history, but
is at this day preserved in the title of the monarch,
who is styled “King of the Swedes and of the Goths.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Hence the two lists of kings—the two kingdoms—the
distinction of history in both; all which have hitherto been
confounded, and so completely as to baffle the keenest
criticism. Not that the king of the one people was not
sometimes the king of both. This could not be otherwise,
when two conterminous nations, jealous of each
other’s prosperity, were eager for the ascendancy. The
superiority, no doubt, was assumed by the sovereigns
of the divine race, the descendants of Odin; but those
of Gothland were sometimes the rulers, and hailed as
monarchs of the Swedes. On the other hand, the
kings of the Swedes—those who reigned at Upsal—were
still more frequently victors over their Gothic
neighbours. Hence the confusion which, notwithstanding
the important distinction we have been so
careful to indicate, will often be found in the regal lists
of this country.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We commence with the hallowed race, the pontiff
kings of the Swedes, who reigned at Upsal. On the
death of Odin, <i>Niord</i> succeeded, as prophet, priest,
and king, in the capital of Sigtuna. It was then,
no doubt, the head of a very small state. Many were
the kings which held Sweden at this time: besides
Gothia, which was subject to chiefs, who, in the sequel,
were generally at war with the Swiones, each province
had its king. Several of the states were bound in
alliance with Niord. Odinsey, in Fionia, was held by
a chief of this nature; Skiold, the son of Odin, reigned
at Ledra, in Zealand; Freyr was the pontiff chief of
Upsal; Heimdal was over the temple at Hemenbiorg;
Thor was at Thrudvang, and Balder at Breidablik.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c017'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
And though Scania was a possession of the Goths, and
not yet subject to the Danish chiefs, it appears to have
been held by some one of the Asser. The reign of
Niord was a happy one; the gifts of nature were extraordinarily
abundant, and the benefit was referred to his
influence with the gods. Before his death he wounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>himself as Odin had done. After it, his body was laid
on the funeral pyre, and he was long worshipped as a
deity. The sceptre was now transferred to <i>Freyr</i>, the
son of Niord. His reign, too, was prosperous, and he
was the idol of his people. He it was who built the
great temple at Upsal, and made it the seat of his
government, in preference to Sigtuna. Here he received
the tribute furnished by his subjects; hence the progressive
enrichment of that place. Universal peace
distinguished his administration. He was held in greater
esteem than his predecessors, and his surname of <i>Yngve</i>
became the proudest distinction of his descendants, who
were thenceforth called <i>Ynglings</i>. His death—we
know not for what reason—was concealed for three
years; the only reason assigned is, that a magnificent
tomb was erecting for him during that period. His son
did not immediately ascend the throne of the Swedes;
there was <i>Freya</i>, the last of the divine personages who
had accompanied Odin from Asia to the north. She
was celebrated in her life, and still more after her
death: her body was not burned on the funeral pyre,
because it was believed she had returned to the gods;
and her statue, as everybody knows, in conjunction
with those of Thor and Odin, long adorned the temple
at Upsal. <i>Fiolner</i><a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c017'><sup>[122]</sup></a>, the son of Freyr, succeeded. He
was contemporary with Frode I., king of Denmark.
Both were equally inclined to peace, and they lived in
perfect harmony. More than once did he visit king
Frode at Ledra, whose hospitality was the admiration
of that age. But one of his visits proved fatal.
Whatever might be his other virtues, sobriety was not
of the number; his potations were long and deep; and
one night, having occasion to rise, he fell into a huge
vessel of mead which was in the cellar, the trap door
of which had been incautiously left open.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a> The
throne now passed to <i>Swegdir</i>, his son. This prince,
accompanied by twelve nobles, went into Asia for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the purpose of inquiring into the family and exploits
of Odin. He wandered over “Turkland” and Great
“Swionia,” the Asheim or Godheim of the Swedes.
Here he found many of his own blood. While in the
territory of the Vanir<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a>, he married a lady of that
nation, and by her had a son, whom he called Vanland.
At the end of five years, he returned to Upsal; but if
any reliance is to be placed on tradition, he afterwards
took a second journey to those distant regions, and
never returned. A wondrous legend has been invented
to account for his death. “To the east of Great
Fionia,” says Snorro, “there is a large villa called
<i>Stein</i>, a rock, from one being placed there so huge, as
to equal a house. One evening, after sunset, as the
king was about to pass from his cups to his bed, he
saw a fairy sitting under that great rock. He and his
companions, being excited by wine, ran towards the
place, and the fairy desired Swegdir to enter if he
wished to converse with Odin. He did enter, and was
seen no more.”<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>34
to
220.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>By the death of Swegdir, <i>Vanland</i> became the
acknowledged head of the Swiones. He was the first
of Odin’s descendants who exhibited a warlike character,
or rather the first that actually went to war.
In the infancy of this theocratic state, when, through
weakness, it was compelled to cultivate the good will
of its neighbours, of conquest there was no dream;
but when the young lion had gained strength, its
natural character was unfolded. His conquests, however,
have not been recorded; and we can only conjecture
that they were chiefly in the provinces bounding
on Upland. Nor do we know that it was a warlike
expedition that led him into Finland. That country,
however, was to him a fatal as well as a romantic one,
While there he married the daughter of an old Swede
established among the Finns. Her he soon left, with
the promise of returning in three years; but ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>having elapsed without any tidings of him, she sent
Visbur, their son, to his palace at Upsal. Still, as he
showed no disposition to visit her, she took counsel
with Hulda, a famous witch,—and Finland was full
of them,—how she might compel him to return. The
witch readily undertook to bring him, or, if she failed,
to destroy him. Her secret charms were immediately
exerted, and Vanland, though enthroned at Upsal with
the attributes of a demi-god, felt their power. On a
sudden his heart was drawn towards Finland; the
impulse to return was scarcely resistible: but his
friends and counsellors dissuaded him from the voyage,
assuring him that he was merely under the temporary
influence of magic. Sleep now overcame him; but
scarcely was he laid on his couch than he cried out
that he was oppressed by that mysterious demon, the
nightmare. His attendants hastened to assist him,
but in vain: the power of the demon was resistless;
and, after violent distortions of his limbs, he was
suffocated. His body was burned; on the banks of
the Skuta his mighty cairn was erected; and <i>Visbur</i>
became the monarch of the Swedes. This prince was
not more faithful, as a husband, than his father had
been. Having married a lady by whom he had two
sons, he unceremoniously dismissed her and them to
her father, and took another to his bed. The offspring
of this second marriage was Domald, whom his nurse,
foreseeing that dangers menaced him, endeavoured to
protect by incantations. In the mean time, Gisle and
Ondur, sons of the repudiated queen, applied to Visbur
for the restoration of their mother’s dowry, especially
of a magnificent golden necklace; on his refusal, they
prayed that the ornament might be his destruction, and
that of his offspring. To effect this object, they had
recourse to magic; and Hulda, who had destroyed the
father, boasted that she would destroy him, and leave
this doom to the whole of the Ynglings,—that either
their arms should always be turned against one another,
or they should perish tragically by some other means.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>The operations of magic, however, were too slow
for their impatience; and they burned their father
with the house in which they found him. <i>Domald</i>
succeeded; but the fates were not to be averted.
During three years a grievous famine afflicted Sweden.
The first autumn, oxen were offered to propitiate the
gods; the second, human victims bled on the altar.
When neither availed, the nobles and priests, assembled
at Upsal, decreed that, as the famine was owing to
king Domald, he should be the next sacrifice, and the
decree was carried into effect. Of the two next kings,
<i>Domar</i>, the son of Domald, and <i>Dygve</i>, the son of
Domar, nothing is recorded except that they reigned
and died; but <i>Dag the Wise</i>, the son of the last-named
sovereign, is celebrated in northern history.
Well might he enjoy the epithet, if, as tradition asserts,
he understood the language of birds. He had a sparrow
which performed the same office for him that the ravens
did for Odin<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a>; it flew over the earth and brought
him intelligence of everything that passed. One day,
however, as this bird was picking some grains in a
field of Redgothia, a country clown killed it with a
stone. Finding that his bird did not return, Dag consulted
the gods, and learned its fate. To avenge himself,
he led an army against the Goths, and laid waste
the region in which the misfortune had happened.
Having taken many prisoners, and left many dead on
the field, he was returning to his vessels, when a dart
from an obscure hand sent him to the halls of Odin.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>220

<p class='c009'><i>Agne</i>, the son of Dag, mounted the vacant throne of
the Swedes. Rich and warlike, he was held in high
esteem; but the fate which hung over the sacred line of
the Ynglings made him another of its victims. In a
successful expedition against the Finns, in which he
had slain the Finnish king, and, agreeably to the manners
of the times, had made Skiolfa, the orphan daughter
of the king, his mistress or wife, he had just returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>to Stocksund, disembarked his troops, and pitched his
tent on the margin of a wood. Here, to perform with
passing splendour the last rites to the memory of
Skiolfa’s father, he assembled a great number of guests.
The cup went round until the king became intoxicated.
As he wore the chain which had belonged to Visbur,
Skiolfa besought him to confide the precious ornament
to her care; but he fastened it the more closely round
his neck and fell asleep. The tent was at the foot of a
tree, and Skiolfa, assisted by her Finnish connections,
tied a strong cord to the ornament, threw one end over
a branch of the tree, and pulling with all their might,
the body of Agne was raised, and left to dangle in the
nightly breeze. The following morning Skiolfa and
her companions were on their voyage to Finland, and
nothing remained to the Swedes but the performance
of the last rites to the royal victim. <i>Alaric</i> or <i>Elrac</i>
and <i>Eric</i>, his two sons, divided the supreme power
between them. For a season they were prosperous;
but they were doomed to share the fate which hung
over the house of Yngve. They were fond of
equestrian exercises, especially of taming the most
spirited horses. One day they rode at full gallop
over an extensive plain; but they were never again
seen alive: their corpses were found with their sculls
fractured; and, as neither had any arms, it was
supposed that they had killed each other with the
reins, or that some malignant demon had destroyed
them both. <i>Yngve</i> and <i>Alf</i>, the sons of Alaric, shared
the government of the Swedes; but they were dissimilar
in character. The latter was studious of peace,
a man of few words, and severe in manner; the former
was fond of war, of his cups, and of conversation,
and often protracted his orgies into the silence of night.
Two such men, whose jealousy was further increased
by the unwise division of power, could not long bear
the society of each other. One evening Yngve stabbed
his brother; but the victim had strength enough left to
return the fatal blow. The supreme power was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>held by one, <i>Hugleik</i>, the son of Alf. His end, too,
was tragical. Being assailed by Hako, a celebrated
sea king and Danish jarl, who numbered among his
captains the unrivalled Sterkodder<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a>, he was vanquished
and slain,—Snorro assures us by the hands of Hako;
but it was, perhaps, by those of Sterkodder. The
victor was not satisfied with the death of Hugleik: he
subdued the Swiones, and forced them to acknowledge
him as their king. Yet he is not ranked by the Icelandic
writers among the lawful kings of the Swedes. He
was a usurper whom <i>Jorund</i> and <i>Eric</i>, both sons, both
sea kings, assailed and slew in the vicinity of Upsal.
But Eric had received a mortal wound, and Jorund
was hailed as the monarch of the Swedes. The new
sovereign, who, during his exile, had obtained considerable
reputation on the deep, retained his attachment
for the profession, which he exercised in the
summer. But it led to his ruin. During his exile he
had slain Gudlaug, king of Halogia: by Gylaug, the
son of that chief, he was met, in Limafiord, defeated,
and hung. <i>Aun</i>, the son of Jorund, surnamed <i>hinn
Gamle</i>, or the Old, now ascended the throne of the
Swedes. He was a prudent man, a great worshipper
of the gods, and not fond of war. During his reign,
says Snorro,—and the information is valuable,—Dan
Mykillati, Frode the Pacific, Halfdan, and Fridleif III.
were, in succession, kings of the Danes. His
peaceful habits, probably, led to the aggressions which
were committed upon him. He was twice expelled
from his kingdom,—the first time by Halfdan, who
reigned twenty-five years in his capital, Upsal, and
there died. This remarkable event is mentioned by
Saxo; but, in his usual manner of confounding names
and dates, the Danish historian calls the Swedish king
Eric instead of Aun. He adds that Halfdan was held
in great veneration by the Swedes, who, in their deplorable
blindness, regarded him as the son of the great
Thor. After his twenty-five years’ reign in Gothia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Aun consulted the gods respecting the duration of his
life, and, to render them more propitious, he offered
his own son on the altar of Odin. The response was,
that, though he was now sixty years of age, he should
live sixty more. But, if he was to live, he was not to
reign that time; for in twenty-five years from the
date of this sacrifice, he was again expelled by Ali, the
son of Fridleif. At the end of twenty-five years more,
Ali, we are told, was slain by Sterkodder. Aun was
again obeyed by the Goths. All this is sufficiently
fabulous; but the following is more so:—After reigning
another period of twenty-five years, he offered his
second son to Odin; and the response was, that, if he
sacrificed a son every ten years to that deity, he should
live for ever; but his vigour was not to be commensurate
with his life. After the seventh sacrifice,
he was unable, during ten years, to walk, and was carried
on a litter. After the eighth, during ten whole years,
he was confined to his bed. After the ninth, he was
fed like a child with milk from the horn. He had
still a son, and would have offered him as the tenth
victim had not the Swedes forbidden the sacrifice. So
king Aun died; and his name was afterwards used
proverbially to denote the diseases inseparable from old
age.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>448
to
545.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Egil</i>, whose blood should have stained the altar of
Odin, became, by his father’s death, monarch of the
Swedes. He now experienced an enemy in Tunne,
who, though a slave, had been the treasurer of Aun.
As Tunne had tasted the sweets of power, he had no
wish to revert to his former condition; and when he
perceived that no distinction was made between him
and his fellows, he repaired to the spot where Aun had
buried a large treasure, dug it up, and with it hired a
numerous body of men to execute his purposes. At
first the new chief betook himself to the less accessible
parts of the country; by degrees, as his band increased,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>there can be no doubt, by proclaiming a servile
war, it rapidly increased,—he issued from the mountain
or the forest, and swept the neighbouring plains.
He was a bandit on a large scale. Egil raised some
force, and hastened to chastise the rebel; but, being
surprised by night in his camp, he lost many of his
followers, and was compelled to consult his safety by
flight. This signal event increased the power of the
rebel, and though forces were repeatedly brought into
the field, victory declared for Tunne in eight consecutive
engagements. In this emergency the king fled to
the court of the Danish king, Frode V., in Zealand,
and offered as the condition of aid an annual tribute.
Frode accepted the offer; and, with a Danish reinforcement,
Egil triumphed over the rebel. During the
three years which intervened between this event and
his own death, Egil sent large <i>presents</i> to the Danish
king; but he would not allow them to be called tribute.
Death was to him, like most of the Ynglings,
tragical: it was occasioned by a wild bull, while hunting
in the forest. <i>Ottar</i>, the son of Egil, succeeded.
Being summoned by the Danish king to pay the tribute
which had been promised, he returned a peremptory
refusal. Frode invaded Swionia, laid waste the country;
while Ottar, equipping a powerful armament, disembarked
in Zealand, and committed equal depredations.
But the latter was defeated and slain by the Danes, and
his body exposed to the fury of wild beasts. <i>Adils</i>,
the son of Ottar, was the next king. He was a noted
pirate, who, in summer, visited and ravaged most of the
coasts round the Baltic. On one occasion he descended
on that of Saxony, laid waste the country, took much
spoil, among which was Ursa, a lady of surpassing
beauty. Of her the victor became enamoured, and
he married her: but, being expelled from his kingdom
by Helge, the son of Halfdan, who reigned at Ledra,
this queen fell into the power of the victor, who, also,
married her, and the issue of this union was Rolf
Krake. But Ursa, who was discovered to be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>daughter of Helge, returned to the court of Adils, with
whom she remained during the rest of her life. On
the death of Helge, in one of his piratical expeditions,
Rolf, or Rollo, young as he was, was acknowledged
king of Ledra. Adils did not long survive his enemy;
he was killed by the fall of his horse.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> <i>Eystein</i>, the
son of Adils, next swayed the sceptre of the Swedes.
His reign was a troubled one, his kingdom being continually
infested by the royal ships of Denmark and Norway,
or, what was worse, by the fierce sea kings. “In
those days,” says Snorro, “were many sea kings, who
levied large forces, though they had no countries to rule.
He was esteemed worthy to be a sea king who never slept
under a tent, and never emptied his horn by the hearth
side.” The most powerful enemy of Eystein was Solvi, a
chief of the Jutes, whose piratical expeditions were known
on many coasts. One night this marauder advanced to
the tent where Eystein was entertaining his friends; and
setting fire to the place, all within were consumed. To
obtain the royal title, Solvi hastened to Sigtuna; and
for a moment he enjoyed it: but the inhabitants rising
to avenge their late king, and to free themselves from
the new yoke, this adventurer soon bade farewell to
empire and to life. The lawful successor of Eystein
was his son <i>Yngvar</i>, who, being of a martial disposition,
visited many coasts. But in 545 he was slain on that
of Esthonia.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>545
to
623.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The next person who filled the throne of the
Ynglings, <i>Braut-Onund</i>, was a much wiser man than
his predecessors. His great object was, to clear the
forests, to drain the marshes of Swionia, and thus, to
convert desert and useless into arable and pasture land.
His efforts were crowned with success. Where the
stagnant pool had stood, golden harvests waved; forests
were replaced by huts full of industrious labourers;
and highways were made to pass over mountain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>fen. “Many,” says Snorro, “were the provincial
kings subject to him.” But this patriotic monarch,
like so many of the Ynglinga, came to an untimely end:
as he and his retinue were one day in the mountains,
they were overwhelmed by a huge avalanche. The
sceptre now devolved to the unfortunate <i>Ingiald Illrada</i>,
son of the deceased king. In his infancy this prince,
we are told, was of too gentle, too mild a disposition,
for the turbulent people with whom he had to deal.
This defect, however, was cured by a peculiar diet,—that
of roasted wolves’ hearts; and Ingiald became as
ferocious as he had formerly been the reverse. But
this change of character was not for the happiness of
the Swedes; and he was destined to be the last of the
Ynglings that should rule at Upsal. His first object
was, to exterminate the local kings, who, like mushrooms,
had sprung up in the country, and who, though
subject to the descendants of Odin, frequently acted as
if they were independent. In the entertainment which
he gave at Upsal, alike to celebrate the obsequies of his
father, and his own inauguration, his character was
fully displayed. Here were six kings,—all who owed
obedience to Ingiald, except the one of Sudermania,—with
a great number of jarls, and other nobles. On
these occasions, the king, or jarl, previous to receiving
the homage of all present,—a homage expressed by a
general shout,—seated himself on a low seat at the foot
of the one which his predecessor had filled. The Bragacup
was then brought, filled with wine to the brim;
and this the new heir, after giving some pledge, was
expected to quaff before he ascended the high seat.
When the cup—a huge horn—was brought to Ingiald,
before emptying it, he vowed to Braga, the god, that
he would, in every direction, double his dominions, or
perish in the attempt. They who applauded the vow
little foresaw the fate which awaited them. That very
night the six kings and the jarls were burnt, together
with the house of feasting. By this atrocious act Ingiald
was absolute master of all Swionia, except that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>district of Sudermania which owed obedience to the
absent king, Grammar. This king soon heard of the
deed; and knowing that his own life was menaced, he
entered into an alliance with a famous sea king, Hiorvardar
by name, to whom he gave his daughter Hildegund.
The entertainment at which this marriage was
first projected is characteristic of the manners of the
times. On one high seat was king Granmer; on
another, the pirate king; and by the side of each sat
his chiefs and friends. To honour the guest, Granmer
called for his daughter Hildegund to present the cup.
She appeared, beautiful as the day, filled the cup, and
approaching Hiorvardar, said, “Hail to the Ilsings!
I drink to the memory of Rolf Krake!”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a> She then
emptied the half of the cup, and presented it to Hiorvardar,
who, seizing it and her hand, prayed her to sit
beside him. “Such,” replied the damsel, “is not the
custom of pirates; they do not allow females to sit and
drink with them.” “Never mind that custom,” pursued
the chief; “but be persuaded to share my seat
and cup.” Hildegund yielded; she drank and talked
with the chief until the night was far advanced; and
the next day she was affianced to him. By this alliance
Granmer acquired a valiant ally; and in the battle
which both had soon to wage against Ingiald they were
the victors. The monarch of the Swedes was compelled
to flee; but, through the intervention of friends, peace
was concluded, on this condition,—that, so long as the
three lived, not one of them should molest the others.
Granmer could now go to Upsal to join in the great
sacrifice and to consult the oracles. The response was,
that his days were numbered: and numbered they were.
While he and his son-in-law were in one of their rural
manors, Ingiald, with a select force, silently approached
and consumed with fire both them and the house. He
then subjugated the districts which the two kings had
ruled, and those of their allies. His surname of <i>Illrada</i>,
the Deceitful, sufficiently shows the estimation in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>he was held. He had a daughter, Asa by name, who
was the heiress of his bad qualities. Married to Gudred
king of Scania, she persuaded her husband to
murder his brother, Halfdan III., king of Zealand.
She then joined in a plot for the destruction of her
husband; but this object was no sooner effected than
she was obliged to flee for protection to the court of
Upsal. Yet here she was not safe. Ivar Vidfadme, the
son of Halfdan, in the resolution of avenging his father’s
death, invaded Swionia, and wrapped it in blood and
flames. When the news of this invasion reached Ingiald,
he was at an entertainment, with his daughter
and many nobles. He knew that he was hated; that
resistance was impossible; that escape was hopeless;
and by the advice of Asa he adopted an expedient which
would, for ever, make his death as remarkable as his
life. This was, to burn himself, his daughter, his
guests, together with the house which contained them.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>By the death of Ingiald, his son, <i>Olaf Trætelia</i>, was
the last of the Ynglings; but his claim to the throne,
however sanctioned by custom or blood, was not likely
to avail in opposition to so powerful an enemy as Ivar
Vidfadme. At this moment, Ivar was at the head of
the Danish, the Swedish, part of the Saxon and Anglian
states (the Angles of Holstein); and his career was not
to be resisted by a youth without army, without followers.
Indeed, Olaf made no effort to resist; he saw
that the people were resolved on the expulsion of the
Ynglings; and, with the few friends who adhered to
him, he hastened to the desert lands north and west of
the Vener Lake. There he cleared off the forests,—hence
his surname of Trætelia, or the Tree-feller,—drained
them, and not only rendered them habitable,
but in a short time made them the foundation of a new
state, that of Vermeland. From him descended the
famous Harald Harfager, monarch of Norway, the
restorer of the ancient glory of the Ynglings.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>The crimes and misfortunes of this dynasty must, to
every reader, contrast strangely with its pretended divine
origin. Compared to it, the fate of our Stuarts was a
happy one. If we except the companions of Odin, the
ends of most were tragical. Fiolner was drowned in a
butt of mead; Swegdir, whatever the manner of his
death, did not leave this world in a natural way; Vanland
perished, not by the hands of witches, but those of
conspirators; Visbur was burnt to death by his own
sons; Domald was sacrificed on Odin’s altar by his
subjects; Dag was killed by a slave; Agne was
hung by his bride; Alaric and Eric were killed by
each other’s hands, or by conspirators; Alf and Yngve
certainly slew each other; Hugleik was slain by Hako
or Sterkodder; Eric died in battle; Jorund was
ignominiously hung; Egil was gored to death by a
wild bull; Ottar was killed by the Danes; Adils
by the fall of his horse; Eystein perished by the
hands of pirates; Ingvar by those of the Esthonians;
Braut-Onund by an avalanche; Ingiald Illrada was
forced to destroy himself; and Olaf Trætelia was
driven into everlasting exile. Thus, out of twenty-two
sovereigns, from Fiolner to Olaf, three only died a
natural death; for that of Olaf, as we shall soon perceive,
was also tragical. Assuredly there was nothing
in the pre-eminence, divine as it was, of the Ynglings,
to render it an object of envy, either to their own times
or to posterity.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The fortunes of Olaf Trætelia and of his successors
may be found in the chapter devoted to the early Norwegian
history. Henceforth Sweden, or to speak more
precisely, the Swedes, are under the sceptre of the Skioldungs,
and not of the Ynglings, though the former, like
the latter, were of Odin’s race, being descended from
Skiold, whose seat was established at Ledra in Zealand.
They did not exercise the sacerdotal functions; they
were not pontiff kings; consequently, they were not
held in the same veneration as those who were privileged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to officiate at Odin’s altar.—Before we proceed
with this Swedish branch of the Skioldungian dynasty,
we must revert to the Gothic dynasty established in
another part of Sweden. At every step we take in the
history of this obscure period, we are more fully convinced
that the hypothesis we have framed is based on
truth; viz., that while the Swiones or Swedes were
located in the provinces bordering on Upsal, and were
governed by their own kings, the Goths were in the
more southern and western provinces, with a dynasty
of their own. Where was the seat of this latter
dynasty? Probably it was not always stationary. It
appears to have been sometimes in West, sometimes in
East, Gothland; just as those provinces obeyed one or
two kings. Scania too, which, politically, was a province
of Denmark, yet geographically a portion of Sweden,
was inhabited by Goths, the seat of whose government
was Lund. As the kings of Scania, or of East and
West Gothia, obtained the preponderance, they were
called kings of the Goths. In the same measure, when
the Danish star was triumphant, Ledra, or Odensee, or
Lund, or some town of Jutland, was regarded as the
metropolis of the Goths. But in each of the Gothic
provinces of Sweden there was a resident court, and
consequently a capital, whose ruler was sometimes dependent
on the king of Scania, sometimes on him of
Upsal, but more frequently, perhaps, independent of
them all. However this be, it is certain that the kings
of all these provinces, except Jutland, have been confounded.
Hence the uncertainty of regal lists, and, in
many instances, their contradiction to one another. In
general, the prince who happened to have the preponderance
for the moment, whether his seat was in the Gothlands
or in Scania, was called king of the Goths. All
were, or professed to be, equally descended from Odin;
nor is this improbable, when we perceive how frequently
a conqueror divided, at his death, his dominions among
his sons. This fatal example, as we have seen, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>set by Odin himself. Over Scania he placed his son
Heimdal; over Zealand and the surrounding islands,
his son Skiold; over Jutland and Holstein, his son
Balder; over the Swedes at Upsal, his kinsman Freyr;
and over the Norwegians, as we shall soon perceive, his
son Semming. Such, at least, is the consistent voice of
tradition, as perpetuated in the oldest records now extant.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From the preceding observations, and from many
others in this and the last chapter, the reader will
be prepared for the amazing variations in the chronological
lists of northern kings, as given by Saxo,
Snorro Sturleson, and Joannes Magnus. Thus the
king of Scania was sometimes the chief of all the
Danes, sometimes of all the Goths, sometimes of both;
but in general the kings of the two Gothlands were the acknowledged
heads of their nation, whether they happened
to be independent, or politically subject to the Danes on
the one side, or the Swedes on the other. Besides, the
intermarriages which constantly took place among
these sovereigns would make them, eventually, of one
great family, even if most of them had not derived
their origin from the warrior god of the north. Still
there were kings who had no such boast, who descended
from a regal stem more ancient than theirs,
whose ancestors were rulers in the Gothic provinces of
Sweden, centuries, perhaps, before Odin was born.
And for anything we can prove to the contrary, there
might, in the interior of Sweden, be reguli who descended
from the original, almost indigenous rulers—from
the old Finnish stock; for though the Goths,
who were there before the arrival of the kindred tribe
of the Swiones, were the dominant caste, they would
govern the inland provinces through native chiefs. At
this distance of time, however, it is impossible to distinguish
the two; nor is it often possible to distinguish
the earlier from the subsequent Gothic princes,—those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>who sprung from ancestors prior to Odin’s arrival, from
those who descended from the Swionian branch.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c017'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>According to the Heimskringla, the oldest and best
authority for Swedish history, when Odin arrived in
the north he found a monarch named Gylfo in possession
of the supreme power.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Was this Gylfo of the
Gothic or of the anterior race? This question cannot
be answered. From one circumstance, viz., his alleged
proficiency in magic science, we should infer that he
was a Finn, were it not doubtful whether the Goths
did not also cultivate this pretended science, and whether,
from the facility of his intercourse with Odin,
and from the locality which he occupied, he was not of
a race kindred with that of the Swiones,—one that
had immigrated into these regions from Asiatic Scythia
centuries, perhaps, before “this king of the Turks.”
Gylfo is said to have ceded to the strangers a portion of
his territory, and that they settled to the north of him.
This statement, again, confirms the inference of his
Gothic descent. However, from that day down to the
permanent union of the two nations—the Goths and the
Swedes—under one head (temporary unions had been
frequently effected), the more southern people had their
own king, their own government and laws. By what
degrees the Swiar obtained the ascendancy over the
Goths may be easily conjectured. The latter were,
at an early period, induced to embrace the religion of
the former, or, we should rather say, a modification of
that religion; for that they, like the Norwegians, combined
a few more ancient tenets with the faith of Odin,
may be inferred from many passages. And with
all due allowance for this circumstance, we cannot but
feel surprise at the facility with which both Norwegians
and Goths were brought to the temples of the new
faith. This could scarcely be the result of force, since
the Swiar do not appear to have been very numerous in
comparison with the rest of the population. Like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Saxons in England; and the Scots in Ireland, and the
Mohammedans in India, they were the dominant caste,
and no doubt their individual valour was superior to
that of the natives. Still, in the earliest Norwegian
and Danish accounts of these remote transactions, we
do not read of the physical so much as of the moral
influence of Odin and his immediate successors. They
might be numerous enough to obtain possession of any
neighbouring province, or even to defeat the petty
chiefs with which the country swarmed; but they
would scarcely be sufficient to make both Goths and
Norwegians embrace a new faith. Between temporal
and religious domination there is a wide difference;
and all history proves that men will fight more
willingly, more perseveringly, for speculative opinions,
than for the most substantial social advantages. The
comparative ease with which Odin, or rather his immediate
successors, thus forced the positive or modified observance
of their religious system on a great population,
has led some northern writers to assume that before
his arrival another Odin had been there, the apostle of a
kindred faith.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a> But this assumption is gratuitous; we
have no good reason for it; and even if we had, the
question would still occur, “By what means did this
<i>former</i> prophet procure the ascendancy of <i>his</i> religion?”
There is but one mode of solving this difficulty, and
this is hypothetical. Probably, as both Goths and
Swedes—perhaps, too, a considerable portion of the
older race—had come from the same Asiatic Scythia,
there was between <i>some</i> of their religious opinions
an affinity, if not an identity; and this affinity
would naturally facilitate the progress of the new
faith. If to this consideration we add the pomp with
which the sacrifices were conducted—the splendour of
the temple—the crowd of officiating priests, with the
king at their head—the imposing solemnity of the
scene—the alleged godlike descent of the pontiff chief—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>reputation which all the Asser priests enjoyed
for supernatural knowledge—we shall scarcely be surprised
at the rapid progress of the Odinic worship. As
a prophet, too, especially one so highly descended, Odin
must have pretended to the gift of miracles, or, what
is the same thing, to the power of effecting wonderful
results by his knowledge of nature’s mysteries. This
combination of circumstances must have imposed on
the Goths, as on the Norwegian and other ancient
tribes. It may account for the facility with which both
nations embraced the new faith, and ultimately acknowledged
even the temporal superiority of the Swiar. It
is certain that as early as even the time of Tacitus, the
latter were the dominant tribe; yet, as they occupied
the sea-coast,—the usual locality of the last comers,—we
may doubt whether they had been there above two
centuries. But this superiority being of a moral, not
of a physical nature, was often resisted by the Gothic
kings, who did not hesitate to march on Upsal, to put
the half divine pontiff to death, and to ascend his throne.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The names, succession, and chief exploits of these
sacerdotal kings, from Odin to Ingiald Illrada, we have,
thanks to the industry of Snorro, been able to lay before
the reader. But over those of the royal Goths a
cloud hangs which time can never remove. All that
can now be done is, from Saxo Grammaticus and the
Heimskringla itself, to reserve a few scattered names.
Gylfo we have already mentioned; and from the
alleged fact—which we have no reason to dispute—that
Scania was previously ceded by Odin to his son
Heimdal, the seat of Gylfo’s empire must have been in
one of the Gothlands. He was followed by <i>Frode</i> and
<i>Sigtrug</i>; the former, remarkable for his liberal presents
to the great temple of Sigtuner; the latter, for his
misfortunes. Gram, a Danish king (probably the ruler
of Scania), having carried off the daughter of Sigtrug,
a war followed, which proved fatal to the Gothic king,
who was dethroned and slain. That he reigned in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Gothland is expressly affirmed by Saxo Grammaticus<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a>,
who relates a graphic incident illustrative of ancient
manners. Gram, says the Danish historian, had heard
that the princess was affianced to a giant, and he resolved
to rescue her from the humiliation; he therefore
went into Gothia, and found the royal maiden, with
some of her female train, washing at one of the rural
streams. Of course she became the prize of the victor,
and so did the Gothic kingdom. But <i>Gram</i> did not use
his success with moderation; and by <i>Swibdager</i>, a king
of Norway, he was slain in his turn.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a> Swibdager was
now the lord of three states,—of Scania, Gothia, and
his hereditary one; but the first he resigned to Guthrum,
son of Gram. It was the lot of Swibdager to
fall, untimely, by the hands of Hadding, another son of
Gram.<a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a> In his Gothic and Norwegian states he was
succeeded by his son <i>Asmund</i>, who, desiring to avenge
the death of the father, was also slain by Hadding.
<i>Uffo</i>, the son of <i>Asmund</i>, succeeded to the quarrel,
though not to the throne, of his two predecessors. That
throne was in possession of Hadding; but he was able
to raise forces and make a diversion, by landing on the
coast of Scania (or, perhaps, Jutland), and forcing the
Danish king to return to the defence of his dominions.
As it was not Uffo’s design to risk a battle in a foreign
state, he sailed for Gothland, and took possession of his
hereditary dignity. But with the returning spring
Hadding resumed his desire of conquest, and, with a
considerable force, landed on the Gothic continent. His
followers, however, were soon exhausted by hunger and
fatigue; and in the ensuing battle he was signally defeated,
and compelled to retreat into Denmark.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c017'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Unable to
accomplish the destruction of his enemy by force, Hadding
had recourse to treachery: he sought an interview
with Uffo, and removed that prince by assassination;
but, according to the Danish account, he placed <i>Hunding</i>,
the brother of Uffo, on the vacant throne. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Swedes, however, assert that it was their nation, not the
Danes, who thus acted; and their statement is far more
credible. Probably there was, as the former assert, a
fierce war between the two; and when both found that
no advantage was to be expected from it, they eagerly
made peace, and were thenceforward more distinguished
for their friendship than they had been for their animosity.
In the fabulous spirit of the times, it is said
that, when one of them heard of the other’s death, he
killed himself through grief. We may, however, admit
that they died within a short interval of each other.
We may add, that this Hadding is not admitted into
the list of Danish, that is, of Zealand kings, by the best
critics; and that for his actions we are indebted to
Saxo. Probably he did not reign at Ledra.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Ragnar</i>, the son of Uffo, succeeded to the throne of
the Goths, but not until he had rescued it from the
domination of his step-mother. His queen was Swanhita,
sister of Frode, a king of Denmark; but this alliance
did not preserve a good understanding between
the two countries. Frode invaded Gothland, but perished
in the expedition,—not, observes Saxo, by the
hands of the enemy, but through a fever, occasioned
alike by the heat and the weight of his armour. On
the death of Ragnar, the sceptre of the Goths was seized
by <i>Holward</i>, or <i>Hodbrod</i>, who was a warlike prince. In
his expedition to Denmark, which was then governed
by Helge and Roe, he left the latter sovereign dead on
the field. But he himself, after his return to Gothland,
was mortally wounded by Helge, and his kingdom became
the prize of the victor. But <i>Attil I.</i>, the son of
Hodbrod, by marrying the daughter of Helge, and, still
more, by the bravery of the Goths, was raised to the
throne. The issue of this marriage, <i>Hoder</i>, became, in
the sequel, king of Scania, no less than of Gothland.
This is the Hoder of whom Saxo—so absurd in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>chronology—makes the contemporary and rival of
Balder, the son of Odin.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a> Ruric, the son of Hoder,
was also monarch of both states. He, as we have before
related, was the grandfather of Hamlet, through the
marriage of his daughter with Horwendil, prince of
Jutland.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a> He governed Denmark through his viceroys,
and always remained in Gothland; for this reason, he
has been often omitted in the list of Danish kings. Of
<i>Attil II.</i> we merely know that he was assassinated by
a Danish emissary; of <i>Hogmor</i> and <i>Hogrin</i>, who reigned
conjointly, that they perished in a battle with the Danes.
But <i>Alaric</i>, their successor, appears to have been identical
with <i>Elrec</i>, prince of the Swedes, the brother of
Eric<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a>; and this conjecture is confirmed by the statement
of the Swedish historians,—that the Goths and
Swedes were at this time united. Probably Elrec ruled
one nation, Eric another. In the Swedish annals, too,
<i>Eric</i> ranks as the brother and successor of Alaric;—a
confusion of chronology common enough in the historians
of this period. <i>Halfdan</i> (or <i>Halden</i>) succeeded,
who was, probably, the <i>Alf</i> of Snorro.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a> This conjecture,
too, is strengthened by the statement of the same
Norwegian authority, that Yngve and Alf shared the
government of the Swedes. Both would scarcely reign
at Upsal; and we have strong reason for inferring that,
while Yngve held that throne, Alf, or Halfdan, reigned
over the Goths. And there is another confirmation in
the fact that, on the death of Alf, the two people obeyed
different rulers. In the reigns of <i>Siward</i>, <i>Eric</i>, <i>Halfdan
II.</i>, <i>Ragnald</i>, <i>Asmund</i>, and <i>Haquin</i> (or Hako), we
observe few points of coincidence between the history of
the Goths and the Swedes: probably they were kings of
the former people only, with the occasional superiority
over Scania. But the name of Hako must not be dismissed
without adverting to an incident which the author
of <i>Macbeth</i> has admitted into the greatest of his dramas.
Hako, resolved to avenge the death of his brothers who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>had been assassinated at the Danish court, descended
with a strong armament on the coast of Zealand, and
marched towards the residence of the Danish king. On
his way, to avoid observation, he passed through the
woods; and when the path diverged into the open plain,
he ordered his men each to cut down a large branch,
that the paucity of his followers might not be discovered.
Great was the wonder of the sentinel, to see a
forest approaching the royal fortress, and he immediately
carried the information to the king. The latter
inquired how far the moving wood was distant from the
walls; and, being answered that it was near, he felt
that his last hour was also at hand. Issuing from the
fortress to meet the foe on the open plain, he met the
fate which he had foreseen.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>448
to
623.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>We now approach historic ground. <i>Egil Auniff</i>, the
next king of the Goths, is, beyond all doubt, Egil, the
son of Aun, whose exploits we have recorded in a former
page of this chapter.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Those exploits are the
same, both in the narration of Snorro, and in that of
later historians of the country: the cause and the result
were the same. Egil, therefore, was king of the Goths
and the Swedes. The <i>Gothar</i> of the Swedish writers,
the successor of Egil, is also the <i>Ottar</i> of Snorro: the
circumstances of their lives are identical.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a> <i>Adel</i> is the
<i>Adils</i>, <i>Ostan</i> the <i>Eystein</i>, of the Heimskringla: in both
histories, as the former was killed by the fall of his
horse, so the latter was burned to death.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><sup>[152]</sup></a> The only
difference in the relation is the circumstance that led to
the death of Eystein; the Norwegian authority attributing
it to Solve, a Jutish pirate; the Swedish, to the
rebellion of a Gothland chief. The <i>Ingvar</i> of the
Swedish writers is indisputably the <i>Yngvar</i> of Snorro;
and the <i>Asmund</i> of the former is the <i>Onund</i>, or <i>Braut-Onund</i>
of the latter. In this latter reign, we perceive the
same encouragement of industry; but the death of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>king is variously related. Snorro, as we have before
related, attributes it to an avalanche<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><sup>[153]</sup></a>; but the Swedish
writers make him fall in battle against a body of rebels.
Of the two next rulers mentioned by the Swedish
writers—<i>Siward</i> and <i>Hirvt</i>—we have no mention in
the annals of the Ynglings. The reason is, that they
were kings of Gothland only, and, probably, dependent
on the monarchs of Upsal: the latter, indeed, is expressly
called the king of the Goths. <i>Ingel</i>, the next
sovereign in the Swedish annals, is, beyond all doubt,
the Ingiald Illrada of Snorro Sturleson, who was king
of the Goths and the Swedes: his exploits, and tragical
death, are the same.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c017'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>We have thus brought down the contemporary monarchy
of the Goths, from the century before Christ to
the conquest of Sweden by Ivar Vidfadme, in or about
the year 623. By regarding these dynasties as separate,
and endeavouring to distinguish kings whom all preceding
historians have confounded, we have made the
subject intelligible to the reader. The path, in which
we have been the first to venture, will, we have no
doubt, be traversed by other writers, until it is as well
known as any other part of ancient Scandinavian history.
It is yet a dark one; and criticism, aided by an extensive
use of manuscript authorities, can alone enlighten it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>623
to
794.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The four next monarchs of the Swedes and the
Goths were also kings of the Danes. Of these, <i>Ivar
Vidfadme</i>, the conqueror of Ingiald Illrada, was one of
the most celebrated. The saga relates of him that he
subdued all Sweden, which he joined with Denmark;
a great part of Saxland, all Estland, and a fifth part of
England. There is, doubtless, some exaggeration in this
statement; but this very exaggeration establishes the fact
of his conquests. The part of England to which the
saga alludes, is said to be Northumbria. No mention,
indeed, of such a descent is to be found in the Saxon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>chronicle, or in Bede; and the silence of this Northumbrian
historian, especially, may be a strong argument
against its truth. Still, in the troubled state of the
times, while the Saxons were struggling with the native
Britons for the possession of the territory, the arrival
of a new chief might well be overlooked, especially
if the conquests of Ivar were confined to that part of
Northumbria which lies north of the Tweed. It could
not well be south of that river in the time of St. Oswald.
But, whether this prince was in England, or not,
no doubt can be entertained of his courage. His hereditary
domain comprehended Scania only; Jutland he
soon added to the rest; but we have no proof that he
ever sat on the throne of Ledra. As king of Gothland
and Sweden, however, without including his conquests
on the coasts of the Baltic, he was a powerful monarch.
“From him,” says Snorro, “henceforth descend the
kings of the Danes and the Swedes.” On his death,
the sceptre of these states was inherited by <i>Harald</i>, his
grandson, surnamed <i>Hildetand</i>, or the Golden-toothed.
This monarch far exceeded the former in glory. He
appears, from the relation of Saxo, to have had some
trouble with the Goths, and also with the Swedes; and
for his success over them he was, according to the same
veracious authority, indebted to the councils of Odin,
who honoured him with a personal interview. From
several passages in this historian, and in the sagas of a
later age, we may infer that the Goths, dissatisfied at
once with the Danes and the Swedes, repeatedly proclaimed
their independence. They belonged not to the
divine race of Odin; and the freedom which their ancestors
had enjoyed before the arrival of “that wizard
king,” was often the stimulant to bold deeds. As they
had revolted from the Swedes, so they were equally
troublesome to the Danes during the four reigns which
are now before us. But Harald triumphed, and governed
both nations through his royal kinsman. Other
parts of the world witnessed his valour: but it was his
fate to die in battle, and in his old age, against his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>nephew Sigurd Ring, who wished to expel him from
the throne of Denmark. In the north of Europe, the
battle of Bravalla is celebrated as any in ancient or
modern times. Saxo, with much care, enumerates the
royal chiefs who fought on both sides; but their number,
no less than that of the common men, exceeds all
belief. The aged and blind Harald was carried about
in a war chariot; and, from time to time, he inquired
how the battle proceeded. Above all, he was struck
with the admirable manner in which Sigurd Ring had
drawn up the hostile ranks; and he expressed his conviction
that this arrangement was not the result of
mortal science, but of Odin’s peculiar favour. The
charioteer whom he addressed was no other than Odin,
under the form of a Danish chief; and, by the hands
of that deity, he received a deadly blow, and was thrown
on the ground. According to Saxo, he was succeeded
by <i>Olo</i> and <i>Omund</i>, in succession; but the Icelandic
authorities, who make the conqueror <i>Sigurd</i>, or <i>Siward
Ring</i>, his successor, are more entitled to credit. Probably
Olo and Omund were viceroys only, though they
might be of royal origin. Many, according to Saxo,
were the kings who intervened between Harald Hildetand
and <i>Ragnar Lodbrog</i>; while the more critical historians
of modern times, supported by Icelandic authorities,
pass at once from the one to the other. At this
distance, and without the aid of documents clearer than
any that have yet been published, it is impossible to
say which of the lists is the true one: but the probabilities
are in favour of the Icelanders; for, though the
kings enumerated by Saxo may have ruled in some parts
of Denmark, they were, it is believed, rather viceroys
than monarchs. By means of local governors, indeed,
the four princes whose names fill this paragraph must
have reigned; their states were too numerous, too extensive,
for personal superintendence, especially when,
as was generally the case, they were absent on foreign
expeditions. To the exploits of Ragnar we have scarcely
alluded, even in the Danish portion of the history; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>reason is, that we can see in them little which is consentaneous
with truth,—little which is not a monstrous
outrage of probability.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c017'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>794
to
1001.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the death of Ragnar, the throne of Sweden fell
to one of his sons, <i>Biorn I.</i>, surnamed <i>Jarnasido</i>. Of
him we know little more than that, in his reign, the
first attempts were made to christianise the Swedes.
Biorn was not averse from toleration; and he allowed
St. Anscar to teach, baptize, and preach unmolested.
But the good thus effected was transient: Anscar returned
to Germany, to procure from pope and emperor
some amplification of his authority; and, during his absence,
the mission entirely failed. When Anscar paid
a second visit to this kingdom, he found a king named
<i>Olaf</i> in possession of the throne. Who was he? Olaf
Trætelia had been dead near two centuries, and Olaf
Skotkonung did not reign until above a century afterwards.
Either, therefore, we have a sad confusion in
chronology, or there must have reigned a king whom
modern criticism does not acknowledge. The probability
is, that Olaf was a king of Gothia, who, in the
numerous insurrections of the period, had seized on the
royal authority in Sweden, no less than in the more
southern provinces. <i>Eric I.</i>, the son of Biorn, is next
classed among the Swedish kings; and, after him,
<i>Eric II.</i>, surnamed <i>Raefilson</i>, who was, probably, either
a Gothic king, or an usurper. <i>Emund</i> and <i>Biorn II.</i>—the
one ruler of the Gothlands, the other of Sweden—next
ascended the throne, and were followed by <i>Eric III.</i>,
the son of Emund; but the reigns of all were short,
and they have left no records for posterity. Indeed, the
number of kings during the ninth century is so considerable,
that we are compelled to infer the existence
of separate kingdoms amongst the Goths, while we are
unable to distinguish the two dynasties of kings.
<i>Biorn III.</i> (923) enjoyed a long reign; <i>Eric IV.</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>surnamed the Victorious (993), one still longer; and
<i>Eric V.</i>, surnamed <i>Arsaell</i> (1001), closes the list of
pagan kings:—not that he was a pagan; on the contrary,
as we shall perceive in the chapter devoted to the
introduction of Christianity into the north, he died for
the new faith. But he had been reared a pagan; at his
death the greater part of the kingdom was pagan; and
it was reserved for his son, Olaf Skotkonung, to render
Christianity the established religion of Sweden and
Gothland.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c017'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The confusion at this period of Swedish history, viz.,
from the close of the eighth to that of the tenth century,
is greater than at any former period. No fewer
than sixteen kings are said, by different historians, to
have swayed the Swedish sceptre in little more than two
centuries. The cause of this confusion is very obvious.
Not only were the kings of Gothland, when that province
happened to have a separate king, enumerated
with those of the Swedes, but the successors of Olaf
Trætelia were equally confounded with them: in other
words, the royal chiefs of <i>three</i> contemporary states
have been classed as kings of the Swedes only,—as the
sovereigns of Upsal. This confusion has rendered it
scarcely possible to distinguish either the royal names of
each state, or the actions attributed to them. We may,
however, assert, with confidence, that Olaf Trætelia, and
Ingel (or Ingiald), his son, were not kings of the
Swedes; on the contrary, they were sovereigns of a state
far to the west,—Vermeland and Raumarik.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c017'><sup>[157]</sup></a> If, as
some historians assert, a king named <i>Charles</i> reigned at
this time in Sweden, his seat could not have been Upsal;
it must have been some town of East or West
Gothland. The same may, we think, be asserted of
<i>Emund</i>, who reigned in the south, while Biorn reigned
at Upsal, or Birca. But Eric IV., surnamed the <i>Victorious</i>,
was certainly king of both the Goths and the
Swedes. The successful wars in which he engaged, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>which procured him that epithet, are too obscure to be
distinguished from the chaotic events of this period.
<i>Eric V.</i>, surnamed <i>Arsaell</i>, or the Happy-born, the father
of Olaf Skotkonung, was also king of the two provinces.
He embraced Christianity, and was baptized in public
at Upsal, together with many of his nobles. It was,
probably, as much for this reason, as for the extraordinary
abundance which Sweden enjoyed in his time,
that he obtained the epithet that posterity has attached
to his name. There is much obscurity over this monarch’s
reign. By some writers he is said to have been
so alarmed at the murmurs of his people, for his abandonment
of the old religion, that, to pacify them, he
reverted to it. By others, again, it is asserted that he
stedfastly adhered to the new faith; that he laboured,
with some success, to withdraw his subjects from the
errors of idolatry; that he went so far as to demolish
the heathen temples; that at Sigtuna he met with little
opposition; but that, when he ventured to lay hands on
the magnificent temple of Upsal, the people arose and
put him to death. To reconcile these contradictions
would be a vain attempt. All that yet remains to be
communicated respecting this, and one or two preceding
reigns, may be found in the chapter devoted to the
origin of Christianity in these regions.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c017'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>That</span> Norway had its chiefs with the regal title, if
not prior to our Saviour’s birth, many centuries before
the fall of the Ynglings in Sweden, is undoubted. We
find allusions to them in Danish and Swedish history,
and in chronicles which, though of a later period, were
derived from sources now lost. The country was full
of them. Most of them, as we have already observed<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c017'><sup>[159]</sup></a>,
boasted of their descent from an old Finnish race,
which, though half mythologic, had, in primeval times,
produced many chiefs of illustrious name. But of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>deeds we have no evidence beyond the little supplied
by the uncertain voice of tradition; and that little is so
exaggerated by fable as to be useless. We will not
rescue their names from oblivion: our narrative must
accompany the fates of the Ynglings from their first
settlement in Vermeland in Sweden, to their conquest
of Norway. In regard to the latter country, we shall
only observe that when Olaf Trætelia laid the foundation
of a new power, it had as many reguli as at any
former period. To subjugate them in succession, and
to incorporate their petty states into one great monarchy,
was the constant aim of his successors.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>630
to
640.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The province of Vermeland, to which Olaf Trætelia
retired, and in which he laid the foundation of a
new state, was, as we have before observed, situated to
the north of the Vener Lake. Here the assiduity with
which he and his followers cleared the ground of its
forests procured him, at Upsal, the scornful application
of <i>Trætelia</i>, or Wood-cutter. But he despised the
ridicule, and persevered. By degrees, many thousands
of the people, whom attachment to the Ynglings, or
the hope of greater freedom in the woods, rendered discontented
at Upsal, or Sigtuna, or Birca, hastened to
join him. Some writers assert that he returned for a
season to his capital, and ruled the Swedes as his
ancestors had done. But this statement is unsupported
by any ancient authority, and is hostile to reason.
Vermeland might well be confounded with Upland, for
both were and are Swedish provinces. But the very
circumstance which should have fortified him against
the power of his enemies occasioned his death. The
number of new comers was so great that the region,
which was yet imperfectly cultivated, was unable to
support them; the colony became a prey to famine,
and the visitation was, as usual, ascribed to the king.
According to the religious notions of the Swiar, every
public misfortune was a proof that the gods were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>offended: but they could not be offended without a
cause; and, as the monarch was the representative of
the whole society, he was held responsible for the
calamity. Besides, Olaf was not very zealous in the
observances of religion; he seldom offered sacrifices;
and his blood only could propitiate the deities. By a
large body of his subjects his house was surrounded,
set on fire, and consumed with him,—a meet sacrifice
to Odin for an abundant year. This prince deserved a
better fate. His name will be held in remembrance,
not only as the founder of a new kingdom, but as one
who laboured with much zeal for the welfare of his
people. By his marriage with Solveig, the daughter
of Halfdan, king of Soleyr, a state lying to the west of
Vermeland, and founded about a century before his
own, he left to his successors a claim on that province.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>640
to
840.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Olaf left two sons, Halfdan and Ingiald. The
former, on the tragical death of his father, was with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>grandfather in Soleyr, but he was followed by the
Swedes, and demanded from the old king. The latter,
however, having no desire to surrender his grandson to
the murderers of the father, resisted, and a battle
ensued, in which he lost his life. <i>Halfdan</i> was raised
to the government of both states, and, with the aid of
both, he subdued Raumarik, a country west of Soleyr.
The three formed a compact and scarcely accessible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>kingdom, which, when governed by chiefs of enterprise
and policy, could not fail to extend its limits to the
west and north. Like his father, Halfdan studied how
to promote the interest of his new state by a matrimonial
alliance. North of Raumarik lies Hedmark, a
small province subject to a king named Eystein. Its
situation was so convenient in respect to Raumarik and
Soleyr, that Halfdan eagerly sought and obtained the
hand of Esa, daughter of Eystein. This union affording
him a pretext for interfering in the affairs of that
province, half of it, by force or policy, he soon added
to his other states; and he afterwards subdued a considerable
portion of Westfold, which he claimed in
right of Hilda, princess of Westfold, the wife of his
son. He died at Thotnia, one of his new acquisitions;
but his body was carried to Westfold, and there
interred. Over Vermeland was his brother Ingiald;
and after the death of this chief the province was
administered by jarls.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>730
to
840.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Eystein</i>, the son of Halfdan, succeeded to the united
crowns of Raumarik and Westfold. As the latter province
was maritime, Eystein built vessels, and followed
the ordinary as well as most honourable profession of
his time,—that of piracy. According to the tradition
which the poet Thiodulf perpetuated, he perished in
one of his expeditions. He had the temerity to disembark
on the coast of Varnia,—the king of which was
a great magician,—to lay waste the region bordering on
the sea; to carry to his ships everything upon which
he could lay his hands, and to slaughter the cattle on
the sea-shore. Scarcely had he embarked, when the
wizard king arrived. The latter knew how to be
avenged. Shaking his mantle in the air, and blowing
from his mouth, another vessel suddenly appeared close
to that of Eystein, and the spar which was used for
distending the sails striking the king, who was sitting
at the helm, he was thrown overboard. The sailors
flew to his aid, but could not rescue him from the
waves until the vital spark had fled. <i>Halfdan II.</i>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>son of Eystein, is noted for a strange inconsistency in
his conduct. To his followers—and as a piratical
chief he had many—he gave, in the shape of wages,
as many golden as other kings gave silver pieces of
money; yet he almost starved them for want of food.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c017'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
The sceptre was now swayed by <i>Gudred</i>, the son of
Halfdan, who, from his chief pursuit, was called the
hunter king. He was also called Gudred the Magnificent,
probably from the extent of his dominions, no
less than from his wealth. None of his predecessors
understood better the art of profiting by matrimonial
alliances. His first wife was Alfhilda, daughter of the
king of Alfheim; and with her he received, as dowry,
a part of Vingulmark. As this province was bounded
on the north by Raumarik, on the west by Westfold,—both
on the southern confines of Norway and Sweden,—it
was a valuable acquisition. On her death, in
looking round where his dominions could be most conveniently
extended, the maritime coast of Agder, which
lay to the south of Westfold, and which, like that province,
is now a portion of Christiania, as Raumarik is of
Aggerhus, he demanded Asa, daughter of that king.
On the refusal of Harald to bestow the princess on
him,—probably from a knowledge of his ulterior
policy,—he equipped a fleet, sailed to the coast of
Agder, disembarked, hastened to the royal abode, and
assailed king Harald, who fell in the battle, together
with the heir of the province. Agder therefore became
an easy prey to this ambitious monarch. But it was
his doom to fall by the hand of a domestic, at the
instigation of his second wife, Asa, many years after.
His states were now divided between <i>Olaf</i> and <i>Halfdan</i>;
the former his son by Alfhilda, the latter by Asa: the
one reigned in the east (Vermeland), the other in the
south. Vermeland, at this time, was tributary to the
Swedish kings; its contiguity, indeed, to Upsal, rendered
it too liable to conquest by the successors of Ivar
Torfœus, Historia Norvegica, tom. i.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Vidfadme; and its geographical posture placed it within
the limits of Sweden rather than those of Norway, into
which the dominions of Gudred were now extending.
It is to Halfdan, the son of Gudred, that our narrative
must chiefly remain, especially as his glory was doomed
to eclipse that of all his predecessors.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c017'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>840
to
850.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the state of the kingdom when <i>Halfdan
the Black</i>, by the tragical death of his father, became
sovereign of one portion. Probably, however, the
superiority over the whole rested with his elder brother,
Olaf. But when his father died he was only a year
old; and his brother Olaf, or his kinsmen, seized the
administration of the whole kingdom, except his maternal
inheritance of Agder. His position was, therefore,
not enviable; and no one, at this moment, could have
predicted his future success. To his mother, who,
during his minority, undertook the government of
Agder, and who raised him under her own eye, he
was probably indebted for many advantages. On
reaching his eighteenth year he assumed the government
of Agder, and hastened into Westfold to demand
from his brother Olaf some portion of his inheritance.
It was on this occasion that the partition of the province
took place, probably to the dissatisfaction of Olaf;
but Halfdan had a strong body of troops, and the
provincial states, whose authority was superior to that
of the crown, were not regardless of justice. But
other provinces, the administration of which had been
usurped, were yet to be recovered; and events soon
proved that he was likely to sustain the interests of his
house. With the force at his command he hastened to
Vingulmark, to claim the portion of that province
formerly held by his father. Though he encountered
resistance enough, he attained his object, namely, one
half of the province. He next marched into Raumarik,
which he recovered. This act brought him into hostility
with Sigtrug, king of Hedmark, son of Eystein,
who, like other monarchs of the time, had committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the fatal error of dividing his states. Halfdan was
victorious; and Sigtrug compelled to flee, wounded by
an arrow. Another son of Eystein, who also ruled in
Hedmark, attempted to continue the war; and, during
the absence of Halfdan in Westfold, invaded Raumarik.
The latter hastily returned, defeated this new enemy,
and pursued him into Hedmark, which he also subdued.
But the resources of Eystein were not exhausted: twice
was he enabled by his royal allies in the north to
remove the warfare; yet he was twice vanquished.
Seeing that there was no hope from hostilities, he threw
himself on the mercy of Halfdan, who, says the historian,
granted to the kinsman what he had refused to
the enemy, namely, one half of Hedmark. Two districts
more, bordering on Hedmark,—small in extent,
but convenient for their site,—were soon added by him
to his other possessions.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c017'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>850.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Here Halfdan paused in his career of victory, to try
what could be gained by marriage. Sogne lay contiguous
to one of his districts; its king had, fortunately,
no son, but a marriageable daughter; and he
obtained her hand. The offspring of this union was a
prince, Harald by name, who, according to the manner
of the times, was sent in his boyhood to be educated at
the court of his maternal grandfather. On the death
of that relative, young Harald was hailed as the future
sovereign; but the mother and the prince soon followed
him to the tomb, and Halfdan had only to march to
Sogne to take possession of it, as the nearest heir to all
three. At this time the princes who reigned over a
portion of Vingulmark endeavoured to surprise him
amidst the darkness of night; and though they failed
in this purpose, they were able, through their numerical
superiority, to defeat him. This check, however,
was but temporary: he soon collected a large force,
and was the victor in his turn. The whole of Vingulmark
soon yielded at his summons.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c017'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>852
to
863.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Halfdan was too regardful of his interests to pass a
long widowhood. The ample province of Ringarik lay
immediately west of Westfold. It was ruled by
Sigurd, surnamed <i>Hiort</i>, or the Stag, from his addiction
to the chase. Besides a daughter, this prince
had a son; but the latter was yet an infant, and the
chances were in favour of the daughter becoming the
sole heiress. The circumstances preceding and attending
this second marriage are illustrative of social manners.
Sigurd was of large proportions, of indomitable
bravery, and of great success in duels, which at the age
were so common. In his twelfth year he is said to
have vanquished a noted berserk, and eleven of his
fellows, in succession. But his delight was to ride
alone into the most solitary forests and the scarcely
accessible mountains of Norway, to fight with beasts of
prey. One day, as he was wandering in quest of his
four-footed enemies on the confines of Hadaland, he
fell in with Hako, a noted berserk, accompanied by
thirty more. A combat followed, which proved fatal
to Sigurd; but twelve of Hako’s company fell before
him, and that chief lost a hand and received some
dangerous wounds. He was carried immediately into
the neighbouring kingdom of Ringarik, to the residence
of the deceased Sigurd. According to the manner
of the times, he took Ragnilda, the daughter,
and Guthrum, the son, of Sigurd, with an immense
prey, and returned into Hadaland, where he had considerable
lands. His dearest object was to celebrate
his marriage with Ragnilda, but the severity of his
wounds rendered some delay unavoidable. His nuptial
day was never to come. Halfdan no sooner heard of
this event than he ordered Harek, one of his chiefs, to
fetch the princess to his palace. Accompanied by a
hundred men, Harek hastened to the residence of Hako,
approached it during the silence of night, broke into
the place, seized Ragnilda and her brother, and, setting
fire to the house, returned with the illustrious captives.
Hako, indeed, had strength enough to rise and pursue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the fugitives. In vain: before he could reach the lake
which lay in the path, and which, as it was the yule
season, was frozen over, they were far before him. In
despair he fell upon his own sword, and was buried on
the margin of the lake. Halfdan was on the other
bank; and no sooner did he perceive the vehicle
moving over the distant ice than he knew his commands
had been successfully obeyed. He therefore
ordered a banquet to be prepared, and guests to be
invited from every part of his own country. That
very day, in presence of his assembled guests, the
nuptials were celebrated. The issue was the famous
Harald, surnamed <i>Harfager</i>, or Fair-haired. We have
no wish to record the dreams which, previous to the
birth of the prince, raised the anxiety of the two
parents. Such portents are always invented in regard
to men whom fortune has elevated above their fellows.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c017'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>863.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Halfdan the Black was, for his age, a superior
prince. He made some laws, and, what is much
better, he caused them to be observed. His legislation,
of course, was truly Gothic; that is, crimes were visited
with pecuniary mulcts, varied according to the rank of the
culprit and of the person injured. He was not so fond
of his youthful son Harald as was the mother, Ragnilda;
yet the qualities of the boy were such as to
excite the admiration of an heroic age. The death of
this king was, in the superstitious opinion of the times,
preceded by a wonderful circumstance. As he was
sitting at table with a multitude of guests, to celebrate
the yule festival, the meats and drinks suddenly
disappeared. The latter, alarmed at the portent,
quitted the table, and left the king alone. What could
be the meaning? A Finnish magician was seized,
put to the torture, and commanded to say what the
portent indicated. But he could or would say nothing;
and he besought prince Harald to procure his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>liberation. Harald applied to the king; but finding
him inexorable, he allowed the poor Finn to escape,
and was the companion of his flight. At this time,
Harald was only ten years of age; and he was to see his
father no more. Immediately after this event Halfdan
returned, on a sledge, towards another part of his
dominions. In his way was a lake, which was to be
crossed over the ice. But holes had been made in it,
for the cattle to be watered; a thaw had commenced,
and the king had not proceeded far before the ice gave
way, and he was engulfed in the cold abyss; most of
his attendants perishing with him. Thus ended the
short but memorable career of Halfdan the Black.
His memory was always dear to Norway; and during
his life he was always reverenced as one of the greatest
benefactors of his people. A prodigious crowd arrived
to honour his funeral; but they would not allow the
body to be interred in Raumarik. During his reign
the land had been so fertile that he was believed to be
an especial favourite of the gods. Wherever he was,
dead or alive, prosperity was expected; and the warriors
from the different states of his kingdom demanded that
he should be buried in their district. The dispute, we
are told, was ended by the division of his body into
four parts, corresponding with the four shires of
Raumarik, Ringarik, Hedmark, and Westfold. The
head was buried in Ringarik, the other members in
each of the other districts. Hence, says the historian,
the number of sepulchres which are still called the
tombs of Halfdan.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c017'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>863.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>As <i>Harald Harfager</i> was but a child when his father
was drowned, the neighbouring reguli, under the pretext
of recovering what their predecessors had lost,
hastened to divide his ample inheritance. One party
invaded Hedmark, a second Westfold, a third advanced
towards the residence of Harald, to make him prisoner.
But he had a noble defender in his uncle, Guthrum<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c017'><sup>[169]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>whom he made general of his troops, and his minister.
This chief collected troops, and, with the young king,
marched against the invader of Westfold, whom he
defeated and left dead in the field. The place where
this great victory was achieved was called <i>Hakadal</i>, or
Hako’s Dale, from the name of the chief who fell there.
Another invader of that province, Gandulf, was defeated;
but, more fortunate than Hako, he contrived to escape
with life. Seeing the fate of these two battles, the
remaining princes determined not to fight singly, but
in concert; and a meeting was appointed in the rock
mountains of the upland province of Hedmark. But
the intention was soon known to the two heroes; and,
proceeding, without loss of time, to the appointed place,
they fell, at midnight, on the outposts of the camp,
while two of the chiefs were sleeping, and in the
skirmish which ensued, sent two other kings to join
them in the hall of Odin. The fruits of this victory
were not only the recovery of all which had been
invaded, but the acquisition of several districts to the
north and west of his hereditary possessions. When
Gandulf returned to the charge, he was again defeated,
and sent to drink mead, to feed on the grisly boar, and
to fight with the dark shades of Odin’s warrior ghosts:
his dominions as far as the river Raum became the
prize of the victor.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c017'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>865
to
868.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After these unexpected successes, Harald thought
that he might aspire to the favours of any princess in
the north. Hearing of the charms of Gyda, daughter
of Eric, jarl or king of Hordaland, he sent messengers
to her, not with the offer of his hand, but of his heart.
The reply of the lady, if any faith is to be reposed
in tradition, was unequalled for its pride. So far from
being the mistress, she would not be the wife, of one
whose territory consisted in a few insignificant provinces;
she would never marry any one beneath the
dignity of a monarch,—who did not, like Eric of Sweden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and Gorm of Denmark, hold absolute sway over
the whole country. The answer of the heroine being
brought to the king, he admired her ambition, and
vowed to the gods that he would never cut or comb his
hair until he had subdued the whole of Norway—until
its revenues and authority were his: and if he
failed in his attempt, the penalty should be his life.
All this is fable: Harald needed not a woman’s advice
to enter on a career which he had long meditated, and
which his father had, probably, meditated before him.
He might, however, make the vow. In pursuance of
that vow, which was highly pleasing to Guthrum, he
enlisted all the forces he could, and marched towards
the north, through Godbrandsdalia, having the Dofrafeld
mountains on his left. The inhabitants fled at his
approach into the uplands; some into Orkadal, others
into Ganlardal, others into the recesses of the mountains;
but many—perhaps the greater number—preferred
his yoke to exile and ruin: they did homage,
and were unmolested. Pursuing his way into Orkadal,
which lay beyond the Dofrafeld chain, in the modern
province of Drontheim, he defeated an army, there
assembled to oppose him, received the homage of the
royal general, and annexed Orkadal, as he had done the
intervening regions, to the other dependencies of his
crown. Nor must it be forgotten that he was the
great champion of the feudal system. Wherever he
conquered, he abolished the allodial law of inheritance,
and converted all lands into fiefs, to be held from him
alone, on the usual obligations. But he did more: he
insisted that all rents should be paid in kind; that one
third of the portion accruing to the crown should be
set apart for the support of the local government.
Over each province he placed a jarl, whose duties were,
to defend it against all enemies, to collect the revenues,
to preside over the local administration. Associated
with each jarl were four, at least two, herser or councillors,
whose office was at once military and administrative;
and to each was awarded a benefice of twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>marks in yearly value. In time of war each jarl was
to support sixty, each of the herser twenty, armed men,
at his own expense. So ample were the revenues of
each province, that the jarls were more wealthy and
more powerful than many royal chiefs of the period.
Hence the dignity was an object of ambition, and he
who could bestow it did not want applicants for it: in
the hope of obtaining it, most of the nobles hastened to
join him whenever he entered a province.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c017'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>867
to
882.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>From Orkadal Harald transferred his arms to Ganlardal,
which is now also a portion of Drontheim,
immediately to the east of the Swedish province of
Jamtland. In this expedition he is said to have been
joined by Hako, a powerful jarl, by whose aid he subdued
the whole province, and the adjoining one of
Strinda. In reward for this timely service he placed
Hako over the new conquest, with the dignity and rights
of jarl. Proceeding still to the north, the conqueror
subdued Stiordal, Veradal, Scaunia, and Sparbyggia,
all situated in the modern government of Drontheim.
The islands in the west were, at the same time, subjected
to his sway. Still Harald proceeded to the
north, and the two kings of Naumdal submitted, one of
them being invested with the dignity of jarl. Thinking
that he had now penetrated far enough into the north,
since there was nothing beyond Naumdal but vast
marshes and trackless forests, scarcely habitable by
men<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c017'><sup>[172]</sup></a>, Harald returned into Drontheim, where he resolved
to await the return of spring, before pursuing
his conquests in the south. In that province he fixed
his abode, and built a town, which he resolved to make
his usual seat of government. There he forgot Gyda,
so far as to marry Asa, the daughter of jarl Hako; but
perhaps he was merely tired of celibacy, and relied on
his royal prerogative of obtaining another wife whenever
he pleased. He did not, however, pass this season
in mere indulgence; most of it was spent in constructing
new vessels, and in the discipline of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>followers. No one, says the historian, was allowed to
enter his palace, except such as excelled in bodily
strength or courage. To them he committed the building
of his ships, and the command when built. The
rewards which he held out to all champions were so
ample that hundreds flocked to his standard. When
spring arrived he had a formidable fleet, and a large
army,—large, we mean, in comparison of those which
northern kings usually brought into the field. The
first people were the Möre Fylke, or the maritime
inhabitants immediately south of Drontheim. Here
he had to oppose two kings, and, as usual, victory shone
on his banners,—both chiefs being sent to Odin’s hall.
With the two provinces over which they had presided
he adopted the same policy as with those of the east
and north; that is, he subjected them to feudal obligations.
They were intrusted as fiefs to jarl Rognevald,
and with them both ships and men to defend the coast
no less than the interior. This Rognevald was celebrated
alike for valour and wisdom, and was the father
of Rollo, first duke of Normandy, to whose exploits we
shall advert in a future chapter. The summer and
autumn were passed in consolidating their conquests;
the winter was spent in Drontheim in preparing for
new wars; nor did Harald affect to conceal his intention
of subduing Sunmore, a province immediately
south of Raumadal, as Raumadal was south of Nordmore,—both
subject to Rognevald. In one respect
this announcement of his views—this manifest approach
to universal empire—was imprudent, since it enabled
the king of Sunmore to form alliances with the neighbouring
reguli, whom the same common danger served
to unite. But before the confederation could acquire
much strength, he met and defeated the three chiefs
who had brought their powers to oppose him. Sunmore
was the reward of this victory. The king of the
Fiords was next vanquished, and the two districts added
to the two other conquests by jarl Rognevald. Not
that these conquests were obtained without bloodshed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>They were sometimes dearly purchased by the loss of
his valiant jarls and bravest followers. Sometimes, too,
the ambition of those chiefs was injurious to the progress
of the royal arms. Thus Hako, the father-in-law
of Harald, and another jarl, contended with each other
for the government of Sogne (Sygna-fylke); and one
died in the field; the other received a mortal wound,
and died soon afterwards.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c017'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>882
to
884.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The success of Harald gave equal umbrage and
alarm to Eric, the son of Emund, king of the Swedes.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c017'><sup>[174]</sup></a>
Taking the field, the latter subdued Vermeland, and
placed over it a jarl, whose jurisdiction should extend
to Swinasund in the south. Nor was he satisfied with
this acquisition: on the contrary, he asserted that he
would not lay down his arms until he had incorporated
with his dominions Westfold, Raumarik, and the whole
of southern Norway as far as the ocean,—possessions
which he claimed on the pretext that they had once
belonged to his ancestors. This was an unexpected
blow to Harald; but he hoped to arrest its consequences
by negotiation; and for this purpose he solicited
an interview with Eric, in Vermeland. As he
had reason, far more than suspicion, that some of the
chiefs in these provinces were in communication with
Eric, he assembled the <i>Thing</i>, or provincial assembly, in
each, and complained of the traitors. Some cleared
themselves by the ordeal; some redeemed themselves
by the ordinary pecuniary mulct; others were punished
in various ways. From these states he hastened to
Vermeland, to the house of Aki, a vassal of his,
celebrated alike for his riches and dignity, who had
readily undertaken to be the host of the two kings.
On this occasion Aki is said to have adopted the strange
expedient of lodging Eric in old apartments, and Harald
in new ones; and of making the same distinction between
the plate, the furniture, and drinking horns.
The interview was not satisfactory to Eric, and, perhaps,
brought no advantage to Harald; but the latter
was grateful for the hospitality of Aki, while the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>resented the manner in which he had been treated.
Having seen Harald on horseback, and, as if he had a
presentiment of his fate, confided to that king the
interests of his son, he next attended Eric to the neighbouring
wood. Being asked by this monarch the reason
of the distinctions which he had made, he replied that
he hoped king Eric had no reason to complain of ill-treatment;
that, because Eric was an elderly and
Harald a young man, he had thus acted. This reply
did not lessen the anger of Eric, who reminded Aki
that he had once been his vassal. “I have not forgotten
that,” replied Aki, “and I also remember that
thou wast once mine.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c017'><sup>[175]</sup></a> The king immediately drew
his sword, and killed the man whose hospitality he had
so lately shared. Harald, being informed of the deed,
rode in pursuit of Eric, whom, had he overtaken him,
he would certainly have sacrificed to his vengeance.
This unfortunate circumstance embittered the enmity
already subsisting between the rivals. From year to
year hostilities were renewed, chiefly in Gothland, or
the confines of Vermeland; but they were not of importance
enough to recall Harald from the east and
centre of Norway, especially after he had placed his
uncle Guthrum as jarl over all the regions which he
held in Sweden.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>885.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On his return to Drontheim, where he passed the
following winter, Harald found that the reguli of the
provinces were still unconquered; and even many of the
chiefs who lay within his hereditary jurisdiction were
confederating to crush, or, at least, to resist him. It
was, indeed, a formidable confederacy. To crush it,
Harald, with his usual celerity, collected his forces, both
maritime and land, and proceeded towards the south.
The armament which he encountered in the bay of
Hafursfiord was very different from those which he
had hitherto encountered: here were more kings, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>vassals, more men, among whom were the greatest
heroes of Norway. The fate of that country manifestly
depended upon the fate of the ensuing battle. It
was a struggle between monarchy and aristocracy,—between
the sovereign power and a multitude of independent
states,—between an established government and
perpetual anarchy,—between society and domestic piracy.
They whose ancestors had for ages been accustomed to
the piratical life, and had considered it their proudest
calling, were eager to fight for what they deemed their
privileges. The struggle was worthy of the occasion;
prodigies of valour were performed on both sides; but,
in the end, victory declared for Harald. Long was this
victory celebrated in the north. It was held equal to
the most celebrated in ancient times. It was the subject
of several poems, among which is one by Hornkloft,
the Icelandic bard attached to the court of Harald,
whose metrical history was of such service to Snorro,
the compiler of Heimskringla.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c017'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>885.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After this victory, Norway was unable to resist the
conqueror. The reguli, and jarls, and native chiefs,
who refused to submit, were driven into exile. Some,
preferring liberty, or rather an unbridled licence, to an
established government, voluntarily exiled themselves.
From this year may be dated the colonisation, by Norwegian
settlers, of the Orkneys, the Hebrides, the
Shetlands, the Feroes, Iceland; the depredations on
the coasts of Great Britain, and Ireland, and Spain;
the invasion of Russia and Normandy by successful
hordes of pirates. So great an emigration might, one
would suppose, greatly weaken the physical resources
of Harald; but this does not appear to have been the
fact: on the contrary, he spared numerous families to
people the wilds of Jamta, Helsingia, and other regions
more to the north, which, prior to his time, are said to
have been wholly or partially desert. But if Norway
was thus his, he had no idle life. The pirates whom
he had banished infested his coasts, until he, in person,
must dislodge them from their strong holds in the
islands of the western ocean. To <i>their</i> and <i>his</i> maritime
transactions we shall advert on a future occasion.—Harald,
being now the monarch of Norway, says the
Saga, remembered that he had accomplished his vow,
and that his hair might be cut and combed. It was
surely high time, if, as we are told, he had resembled,
previously, a wild beast rather than a man, and had
been called Harald <i>Lufa</i>, or “Harald with the Horrid
Hair.” When this deformity was removed,—when the
shears and the bath had done their work,—he obtained
the epithet of Harfager, or Fair-hair. And he now
remembered the saying of the maiden who had excited
him to all his successes. Sending for her, he made her
the partner of his throne; and by her had a daughter
and four sons.—All this is fabulous, but unequal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>what follows, which appears to have occurred some years
before this marriage. One winter, the king hastened to
the uplands to hold the festivities of Yule; and he ordered
the banquet to be prepared in the villa of Thopte.
The evening before the opening of the feast, as he sat
at table, a domestic advanced to say that a Finn,
waiting at the door, wished to see him. At this bold
message the anger of the king and the surprise of all
present may be conceived, and an indignant answer was
returned. But Swaso was resolute: he bade Harald be
informed that he was the Finn whose hut was on the
other side of the mountain, and whom he had promised
to visit. The monarch went to the door, and
immediately said that he would accompany him to the
hut. On their entrance, the daughter of Swaso—a
wondrous beauty—arose, and presented a horn of
mead to the royal visitor. It was a magic drink, designed
to make the king amorous, and it had its effect.
He wished to take her as his mistress; but she had too
much art for this; she would be the affianced bride, or
nothing. That ceremony was promptly and easily
performed, and the royal wish was gratified. So much
was he captivated with the beautiful Snæfrida, that for
years, though he visited, he forgot his country, capital,
his subjects, his throne, his very existence. Four sons
were the issue of this connection,—Sigurd, Halfdan,
Gudred, Rognevald. She then died; but her corpse
preserved the same spotless white as when living.
Corruption could not take hold of it. During three
whole years he sat by the corpse, thinking that every
moment life would revisit it; and his subjects deeply
bewailed his infatuation. To dissolve the spell was the
work of Thorleif the Wise, one of his jarls. The corpse
was removed from the bed on which it lay, when
suddenly the most offensive odour was emitted by it.
It was hastily borne to the funeral pile: serpents, and
lizards, and toads, and every species of venomous reptile
continued to issue from it; yet the king did not regain
his sound mind until the corpse was consumed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Ashamed of his weakness, he resumed his royal duties,
and at once became the pride of his people. Magic
drinks, we need scarcely observe, are of perpetual occurrence
in the annals of the ancient north. Saxo
alludes to many; but none surely was ever so potent
as this,—none before or since, in the wildest dreams of
fancy, could preserve the empire of love for three years
after the death of its object.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c017'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This fable has been noticed that the reader may
be prepared for the dissensions which soon took place
among the sons of Harald. The four whom Snæfrida
had borne him he learned to detest, through hatred of
the mother; and at length he dismissed them from his
palace, with the resolution to see them no more. After
some time, however, one of them, Gudred, went to
Hiodulf, the jarl, who was in great power, and besought
him to procure him an interview with the king. Both
proceeded to the royal palace, which they reached late
in the evening, and they sat on the benches outside the
doors unknown to everybody. Harald happened to be
walking on the pavement in the court-yard—probably
to enjoy the nightly breeze—and his eyes carelessly
wandered over the seats. But the two strangers attracted
his notice, and he asked the elder what had
brought him there? Uncovering his head, Hiodulf
was immediately recognised and welcomed. The veteran
now pleaded for the exiled sons. He observed that if
the mother’s race was bad, the father’s was not; and
that the excellency of the one might more than counter-balance
the evil of the other. The king was persuaded;
Gudred was received into the palace; the three brothers
were sent into the provinces and occupied in military
exercises, in which they excelled other men.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c017'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>869
to
900.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The sons of Gyda and Snæfrida were not the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>ones born to Harald. By his numerous wives—and
he is said to have had nine at the same time—he had
a numerous progeny, who were destined to trouble his
declining years. By Gyda, as we have before related,
he had one daughter, Alofa, and four sons, Sigtrug,
Ruric, Frode, and Thorgils. By Ragnilda, a princess
of Jutland, he had Harald Blodöxe. By Swanhilda,
the daughter of a Norwegian jarl, he had three sons,
Olaf, Biorn, and Ragnar. By Alfhilda, daughter of
the jarl of Ringarik, he had three sons and one
daughter, Dag, Ring, Gudred, and Ingigerda. By the
Finnish witch he had the four sons we have just enumerated.
By Asa, the first of his mistresses, the daughter
of jarl Hako, he had Guthrum, Halfdan the Black,
Halfdan the White, and Sigfred. That he had other
children by his numerous wives is undoubted. Of
these, was Rognevald, and another that must be particularly
mentioned,—Hako the Good, whom, in his
old age, a Norwegian lady, named Thora, bore to him,
and who eventually sat on the throne of Norway. All
these, in conformity with the manners of the times,
were educated by their maternal relatives. Few of
these children survived the father. Their ambition
was great, their crimes greater; and as the king descended
into the vale of years, he lost all authority over
them. The deaths of many were deservedly tragical.
The four sons of the Finn excelled the rest in wickedness.
Incensed that they were not admitted to a participation
in the government, and hating the experienced
jarls, whose advice was so useful to their father, they
burnt Rognevald, the most obnoxious of all, in his own
house, together with sixty of his followers. After this
hellish deed—a deed, however, so common in northern
history, as to excite little surprise—Halfdan fled to the
Orkneys, but Gudred remained. The only chastisement
which Harald inflicted on the latter, was to send him
into Agder, probably to fill some honourable post; but
Thorer, a son of Rognevald, was raised to the vacant
dignity of jarl of Moria. Soon afterwards, Halfdan, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>had usurped the government of the Orkneys, was taken
and put to death by Einar, the lawful jarl; Harald, at
the instigation of Halfdan’s brothers, sailed to revenge
the death of his son; but on reaching these islands, he
accepted a pecuniary mulct, and left Einar in possession
of the government. Guthrum, the eldest of Harald’s
sons by Asa, was the next victim; he was slain in
Gothia by the Swedish governor. Halfdan the White,
while absent on a piratical expedition on the eastern
coast of the Baltic, was killed by the inhabitants. But
the worst evil that the king dreaded was their wars
with one another. To avert this calamity, on reaching
his fiftieth year, he divided his provinces among them,
giving to each the regal title, yet reserving to himself
the supreme title of monarch. Thus, to Olaf, Biorn,
Sigtrug, Frode, and Thorgils, he ceded Vingulmark,
Raumarik, Westfold, and Thelamark; to Dag, Ring,
and Ragnar he resigned Hedmark and Gudbransdal; to
the sons of Snæfrida he gave Ringarik, Hadaland,
Thotnia, and the adjacent districts; Ruric and Godred
had extensive domains in the central provinces, and
were generally resident at the court of Harald; Eric
had Halogaland, Nordmore, and Ramsdal; over Drontheim
were Halfdan the Black and Sigurd, and the
same dignity had been shared by Halfdan the White.
To Thorgils and Frode he gave a certain number of
vessels, with permission to raise kingdoms for themselves,
if they could, in the British islands. They are said
to have conquered Dublin; but both perished fatally,—Frode
by poison, Thorgils by the hands of the natives.
Nor did he forget the offspring of his daughters. While
the eldest children of his sons were for ever to enjoy
the regal title, those of his daughters were to possess
the dignity of jarl, and their seat in the assemblies of
the state to be just one step below that of the male
descendants.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c017'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>920.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In the preceding paragraph, we have seen the tragical
deaths of five among the sons of Harald. These
were Halfdan, Haleg, Guthrum, Halfdan the White,
Frode, and Thorgils. Others were to be soon added to
the number. Rognevald being accused of magic,—a
science which, ever since his adventure with Snæfrida,
Harald held in the utmost abomination,—Eric Blodöxe,
the favourite son of the monarch, was sent into Hadaland,
where Rognevald was then residing. Finding,
or, perhaps, pretending to find, the prince surrounded
by eighty wizards,—poor wizards they, not to foresee
their fate!—Eric set fire to the house, and consumed
all within. This deed, which in our days would not be
considered a merit, was held to be a great one in his.
But another deed of his was not beheld with equal favour.
Biorn, one of his brothers, who, as king of Westfold,
generally resided at Tunsberg, was equally attached to
piracy and commerce. By his frequent expeditions, he
had amassed great riches; and his liberality, no less than
his judicious administration, had won him the respect of
his subjects. On these Eric cast a longing eye; nor was
he less jealous of a brother, who, when his father should
be no more, might dispute his claim to the monarchy,—a
claim which he always advanced, and which his
father had sanctioned. With the view of enveloping
the merchant king in his toils, Eric demanded the tribute
which was due to Harald for the kingdom of
Westfold. Biorn replied that he had always delivered
it into the hands of his sovereign, either personally, or
through his agents; and that he should not, on this
occasion, deviate from the custom. A dispute arose,
and Eric, in great anger, left Tunsberg. At nightfall
Biorn also left it for a marine residence not far
from the city. With a chosen band Eric followed his
steps, and assailed the house as the king sat at table.
With all the domestics whom he could muster, the
latter issued from the house, and a combat followed,
which was fatal to many of his attendants, and to himself.
A rich prey was the reward of this fratricide;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and Eric, exulting, returned to his northern kingdom.
Seeing the odium in which the author of this deed,
notwithstanding his influence over the now weak mind
of Harald, was held by most of the Norwegians,
Halfdan the Black made an attempt to assassinate
the murderer, by setting fire to the country house in
which he slept; but the dormitory was separated from
the main building, and Eric escaped. To revenge this
outrage on his darling son, Harald collected his troops,
and marched against Halfdan; but the intervention of
an aged jarl effected a reconciliation. That reconciliation,
however, was not sincere, so far, at least, as
Halfdan and Eric were concerned.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c017'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>910
to
913.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>For the doting attachment of Harald to the most
bloody of his sons, no good reason has been or can be
assigned. He was not the oldest son, nor was his
mother, Ragnilda, the most beloved of the royal wives.
Yet this paternal fondness did not screen the royal
youth from the dangers of his profession. As early as
his twelfth year, he is said to have become a piratical
chief, and, with the five vessels which he had received
from his father, to have ravaged all the maritime coasts
of Europe from Russia to Ireland. On that of Finland
he had, says the legend, a marvellous adventure,
which, as it has been made the foundation of some
tales popular in the middle ages, we shall abridge.
While he and his companions were in the remotest part
of that magic region, on the very borders of the still
more wondrous Biarmia, they one day reached a cottage
the mistress of which was a supernatural beauty. She
told them that they were in great danger; that she had
two lovers, the most able magicians of the country, who
were also her instructors; that they could hunt the
footsteps of man on snow or ice, with as much instinct
as the blood-hound; that their arrows never missed
aim; that they put all strangers to death; that, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>angry, every living thing died beneath their glance,
and the earth itself was affected. As they came daily
to the hut, there seemed no hope of escape until she
promised to conceal them, and to aid them in the destruction
of her odious suitors. Having concealed
them, she took a linen bag full of what they conceived
to be ashes, and scattered the contents around the hut,
both within and without. The Finns soon entered,
and inquired what strangers had arrived; and on her
replying that she had seen nobody, they expressed no
little surprise: they had traced footsteps in the snow
to the very door. However, they lighted a fire, cooked
their provisions, and when satiated, Gunhilda prepared
her own bed. There she lay down, but they would
not. As they were rivals, both passionately in love,
and each afraid that, while he slept, the other might
obtain some advantage over the lady, they resolved to
remain awake. During three successive nights this
sleeping on her part, and watching on theirs, continued,
until nature was exhausted. Gunhilda saw her time;
she invited both to lie beside her; they joyfully obeyed
her, and she put one arm around the neck of each. The
effect—that of magic (for she had been trained in a
good school), was instantaneous; both fell into a deep
sleep, from which it was impossible to awake them.
There she fettered them, and called on Eric and his
companions to despatch them. The deed was easily
perpetrated, and the corpses were cast outside of the
hut: but it was followed by incessant thunder, which,
during a whole night, prevented them from leaving the
place. When serenity was restored, all left, Gunhilda
with the rest; and before the day closed, the magic
beauty became the bride of Eric.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c017'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>930
to
934.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Fate had not yet done its worst on the offspring of
the Norwegian monarch. His son Gudred perished
at sea. And when he resigned his imperial dignity in
favour of his beloved Eric, other tragedies might have
been foreseen—if not in his lifetime, immediately after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>his death. The elevation of Eric was opposed, among
others, by Halfdan the Black, who, also, assumed the
title of monarch. Olaf, brother of the murdered Biorn,
who had succeeded that prince in the government of
Westfold, did the same. In two years Halfdan was
removed by poison,—the deed, as was commonly reported,
of Gunhilda. Harald was little moved by these
atrocities. So long as his favourite son enjoyed life
and empire, he cared little for the rest. But his own
days were hastening to an end. When he resigned his
sceptre to his son Eric, he was eighty years of age. In
two or three years after that event,—in the year 934,
or, according to others, 936—he paid the debt of
nature. The place of his interment was one of his
manors in Drontheim. Near the spot, a magnificent
heathen temple was erected, which was standing in
the days of Snorro.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c017'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>To dwell on the character of this monarch, after the
ample relation which we have given of his deeds, would
be useless. With the exception of his martial prowess,
of his enterprising spirit, of his unwearied activity, we
see little to praise in him. His numerous adulteries—his
feebleness soon after he had passed the meridian of
life—his blind policy—have not often been exceeded.
Much praise has been lavished on him for his extirpation
of piracy; but he is entitled to little. So
long as his own shores were not visited by the
marauders, he cared not what depredations were committed
on others. His chiefs, his very sons, followed
piracy as a profession, not merely with his sanction,
but at his express command. He has been called the
friend of the peasants, or rather of the humble allodial
proprietors; but did not policy make him so? If they
were plundered by those in authority, could they furnish
the new contributions which, as the first of Norway’s
feudal sovereigns, he exacted from them? Then, as to
his boasted administration of the laws, nothing is more
certain than their perpetual neglect: after he had passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his fortieth year, they were inoperative,—despised by
his own sons, evaded by the jarls. Nor, however brilliant
his conquests, can he be called the founder of the
Norwegian monarchy. If he destroyed many tyrants,
he replaced them by greater: if he united many independent
states into one empire, by his own deliberate
act he broke that empire into fragments, and restored
the anarchy which he had laboured to destroy. Widely
different is his character before and after he had attained
the meridian of life. It seemed as if he were led by
some evil spirit to undo, in the latter period, all that he
had done in the former. But he had no comprehensive
views, no sound policy: during the first half of
his life he fought for ambition; during the latter, he
was the tool of his wives, his sons, and his other favourites.
On the whole, we are disposed to consider
him as inferior to his father, Halfdan the Black.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>934
to
936.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely was <i>Eric</i>, who, from his sanguinary actions,
was surnamed the Bloody Axe (Blodöxe), the nominal
sovereign of Norway, when he called on his brothers to
recognise his title, and pay him the tributes which they
had paid to his father. Instead of complying, Olaf and
Sigurd exacted the usual tributes in their respective
kingdoms,—an undoubted act of sovereignty. To
chastise their presumption, the indignant Eric equipped
an armament, and hastened to Tunsberg, the seat of
their domination: he was met by the two kings on the
declivity of a hill near the city; but, his forces being
much superior in number, they were defeated and slain.
The same fate would have befallen Trygve, the son of
Olaf, and Godred the son of the murdered Biorn,—both
nephews of Eric,—had they not consulted their
safety by repairing to the inaccessible fastnesses of the
uplands. The tyrant was now hated more intensely
than before, and a majority of the people began to look
for a deliverer of the race of the Ynglings. But where
could one be found, seeing that all Eric’s brothers had
either paid the debt of nature, or perished untimely?
There was one exception to this fate: Hako, the last of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Harald’s sons, was still alive, and in England. From
our own historians, no less than from Snorro, it is evident
that friendly relations had always subsisted between
Athelstane of England and Harald, and that presents
had passed between them. One of them was a
magnificent sword, which Athelstane sent to Harald;
and Harald, in return, sent a magnificent ship, with his
infant son Hako to be educated in the polite court of
the Saxon. This simple narrative has been much embellished
by Snorro. He informs us that when the
ambassador delivered the splendid sword to Harald, and
the monarch had seized the handle, the ambassador exclaimed,
“Now art thou the liege man of our lord the
king, in that thou hast received his sword!”—alluding
to the most ordinary symbol of investiture. The proud
Norwegian was exasperated; but, on reflection, he
retaliated in a manner equally ingenious. Causing a
magnificent ship to be prepared, he despatched in it his
son Hako, under the care of a trusty chief. On reaching
the court of Athelstane, he entered the palace,
and laying the young child—then about seven years
of age—on the knees of the king, said, “King
Harald commands thee to educate his bastard!” The
facts are as we have represented them on the authority
of English contemporary writers,—facts which an
ancient chronicler of Norway, Theodric, also admits.
The writers of both countries agree that Athelstane
nobly discharged the duty which he had undertaken.
Hako was educated well, was of course baptized, and
taught the truths of Christianity; and in the English
king he found a counsellor, a friend, a father. He was
about fourteen when he heard of Harald’s death, and
of his brother Eric’s accession. The following year
brought him so many reports of Eric’s cruelty, and of
the desire of many Norwegians to rid themselves of the
tyrant, that he began to regard the throne as his future
inheritance. He had ambition; but in a virtuous mind,
ambition, like every other feeling, may become an instrument
of good. Hako longed to be a king,—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>merely from the desire of power, but from a wish to
benefit his countrymen, especially by diffusing among
them the blessings of Christianity. When, therefore,
many emissaries from Norway arrived at the English
court, and besought him to rescue the country from the
yoke, he readily obeyed the call. Being supplied with
ships, men, money, by his generous friend, about two
years after his father’s death, he sailed towards Norway.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c017'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>937
to
946.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Hako landed at Drontheim, and the inhabitants here
assembled in a <i>Thing</i>, or general meeting, when every
free-born head of a family, who had land, was permitted
to vote, or at least to sanction, by outward expressions
of applause, the opinions of the chiefs. Though most
of them were friendly to the royal youth, they dreaded
the vindictive character of Eric. But in that meeting
the cause of Hako was eloquently advocated by Sigurd,
one of the most powerful jarls. And when Hako himself
arose, so like his father was he, that a murmur of
applause ran through the multitude. When he spoke,
all were attentive; when he promised, on the condition
of their making him king, to abolish the oppressive
obligations of feudality, and restore the lands to their
ancient allodial tenure, one universal shout proclaimed
him king of Norway. The report spread through the
kingdom that Harald was restored in his son, but that
the son had not the worst quality of his father,—that
of oppressing the people by feudal exactions. The
joyful news that the allodial tenure was to be restored,
spread, quick as lightning, over the country. From
Drontheim, Hako proceeded into the uplands, where a
Thing was assembled, and he was received in the same
manner. Here he was joined by many chiefs; among
others, by Drygve and Sigurd, on whom he conferred
the regal title, with the government of Westfold to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>latter, and Raumarik with Vingulmark to the former.
This condition accompanied the investiture,—that half
of their revenues should be paid into the treasury of
Hako, the other half be retained by themselves. Those
revenues, it was manifest, would be much less than they
had been while every estate was a fief belonging to the
crown: allodial property has always been lightly taxed.
Hako now returned to Drontheim, to raise troops and
prepare ships for a contest with his brother Eric, who
was then in the province of Vikia. The case of the
latter was evidently hopeless; though he called the
people to his aid, few obeyed him; and the men who
were with him at the time of Hako’s embarkation, left
him, one by one, to swell the ranks of his rival. He
had no hope of security, but in flight; and he repaired
to the Orkneys. There collecting all the ships and all
the men he could, he proceeded to the south, ravaging
the Scottish coast as he passed along, until he arrived
in Northumbria. This province had never been well
affected to the Anglo-Saxon yoke, which, indeed, was a
very recent one. It had been held for some time by
Danish chiefs; half its population was Danish or Norwegian;
and it had been the prey of the sea kings from
the eighth to the tenth century. Athelstane thought that
if Eric would become his vassal, embrace Christianity,
and defend Northumbria against the pirates of the north,
he would be a far more useful subject than any of the
Saxon thanes. A messenger from the English king
met the exiled monarch: the proposals of the former
were eagerly embraced; Eric and his whole family were
baptized; homage was done for the province; and York
was chosen as the seat of the new government. But
on the part of Athelstane this was an impolitic step.
From common report he must surely have known something
of Eric’s character,—that neither peace nor obedience
could be expected from a turbulent, ambitious,
cruel, and ungrateful man. During the reign of Athelstane,
indeed, he committed no depredations on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>English coast, but he ravaged those of Scotland, Ireland,
and Wales, without intermission. The fame
which he acquired in these expeditions brought many
Norwegians, many Swedes, many Danes to his standard.
During the reign of Edmund the Elder, he appears to
have been absent from Northumbria; and so he was
during the first year of Edred’s reign. He then returned,
and laid waste the English coast. Edred
marched against him, and compelled the Northumbrians
to do homage to him instead of Eric. The latter collected
new forces, and again contended for the kingdom;
but he contended in vain; he was signally defeated,
and, if Snorro be correct, slain on the battle field. But
Matthew of Westminster asserts that, after his defeat,
he was betrayed by one of his chiefs, and slain in
the wilds of Yorkshire. However this be, from this
time Northumbria became an English province: Eric,
as the chronicler of Mailros observes, was its last king.
The widow and sons of this exile being driven from
Northumbria, took refuge in the Orkneys and Shetlands,
where the latter resumed their piratical depredations
wherever prey was to be found. Subsequently, as we
shall perceive, they were entertained at the court of the
Danish king. The character of Eric of the Bloody
Axe needs no comment. He was a favourite with all
pirates, and, for this very reason, with Odin himself.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c017'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>939
to
940.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>By the departure of Eric, <i>Hako</i> was the sole monarch
of Norway, though, as we have before related, he imprudently
left the regal title to two princes of his
family. His first hostilities were against the Danes,
who infested his dominions, but whom he pursued into
Jutland, and defeated a second time. But they came
from Zealand and other islands of Denmark; and in
Zealand he sought and extirpated them. Those of
Gothland were next chastised by him. Harald Blaatand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the Danish king, offended with the presumption of
Hako in thus entering his bays and destroying the
vessels of his people, threatened revenge. To annoy
his brother sovereign and fellow Christian, he received,
with much ceremony, Gunhilda, the widow of Eric
Blodöxe, and her children, and furnished them with
ample means of support. The sons of Eric had been
taught the profession of piracy; and on their settlement
in Denmark, they built vessels, and committed frequent
depredations on Vikia, one of the southern provinces
of Norway. In return, the chiefs of Hako, especially
king Trygve, desolated the coasts of Denmark.
The Norwegian monarch was no less a warrior than his
pagan ancestors; but though he thus violated the spirit,
he was not insensible to the forms, of Christianity. One
of his objects, as we have before observed, in striving
for the Norwegian throne, was the diffusion of the
Christian religion. He did not, however, for some
years, openly interfere with that of his subjects. He
had need of their aid; and he had no wish to estrange
them by an ostentatious display of his own worship.
For some years, therefore, he worshipped in silence.
By degrees he drew his friends, his courtiers, to embrace
the new faith. He next extended his favour to all who
consented to be baptized. The number of converts increasing,
he thought that he might now act more openly:
he accordingly sent to England for a bishop and priests
to become the harbingers of the new faith throughout
Norway. On their arrival, he destroyed some of the
heathen temples in Drontheim and the neighbouring
districts. Many of the pagans showed a philosophical
indifference to both religions: some, south of Drontheim,
would do what the people of that city should do themselves;
the majority were anxious to be guided by the
decrees of a Thing. An assembly was therefore convoked
in Drontheim; but the members being alarmed at the
magnitude of the change proposed by the king, devolved
the decision on a more general one, which should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>convoked at Froste. It was evident that the zeal of
Hako was impelling him too rapidly in the career of
reformation.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c017'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Amidst these transactions, Snorro gives us some
interesting facts respecting the religious customs of the
Northmen. When the public sacrifices were to be
offered,—which, as we have before related, was obligatory
three times in the year<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><sup>[187]</sup></a>,—the whole of the
neighbouring population hastened to the nearest temple,
bearing provisions and mead. On these occasions,
cattle of all kinds, and numerous horses, were sacrificed.
The blood of the victims was called <i>klot</i>; the basins in
which the blood was received, <i>klot-bollar</i>; and <i>klotteinar</i>
were the names of the instruments with which
the blood was sprinkled over the altars, the pedestals, the
walls of the temple within and without, the assembled
multitude, and the provisions which were about to be
eaten. In the centre of the temple was an open space
where the fires were burning; and over them were suspended
the cauldrons and pots destined to cook the
sacrificial meats. The entertainment which followed
was under the care of the sovereign; and it was his
duty to consecrate the meats and cups before they were
used by the people. The first cup was emptied to
Odin for victory and prosperity in war; the second, to
Niord and Freyr, for an abundant season and for
peace; and when these were drunk, it was customary,
in many places, to pour a libation from an overflowing
horn, in memory of deceased heroes and kings. Then
horns were emptied in memory of inferior personages,—of
relatives and friends,—and these were
called the <i>minne</i>, or smaller cups. To these sacrifices,
and to the pagan rites in general, jarl Sigurd, who
had done so much to procure the election of Hako,
was much addicted. He was as zealous, says the historian,
as Harald Harfager had ever been. And he
was exceedingly liberal: in the absence of the king,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>when it was his duty to consecrate the food and drink,
he often bore the whole of the expense,—no slight one,
where so many hundreds of cattle had to be sacrificed,
and so many thousands of people entertained. Hence
his fame was much diffused; and as he was Hako’s
uncle by the mother’s side, he had considerable weight
in the royal councils.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>941.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the day appointed, the national Thing was assembled;
and Hako, after proposing a body of laws
which were readily adopted, and to which we shall advert
in a future chapter<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><sup>[189]</sup></a>, openly adverted to the all-important
subject. He besought the whole multitude, rich and
poor, noble and serf, young and old, the happy and the
wretched, to embrace Christianity,—to acknowledge
one only God, and Jesus, the son of Mary, as his son
and equal. He implored them to abandon the rites of
heathenism,—to refrain from labour every seventh day,
and observe it as a festival,—and to fast another day in
the seven. At these words a murmur went through the
multitude,—all freemen, be it remembered, all proprietors
of slaves, all landowners. Were two days out
of the seven to be thus lost?—for who could work on
a <i>fast</i>-day? If this novelty were adopted, assuredly
the ground could not be cultivated, nor could there be a
sufficiency of food for the people. A rich and popular
landowner of Gaulandal, the oracle of the assembled
multitude, then arose. “When thou, O king, wast
first elected by us in the public assembly of Drontheim,
and didst restore to us the lands of our forefathers, we
all thought that the highest happiness was to be our
lot. But now we are in the greatest uncertainty whether
thou hast really made us free, or art preparing for us a
new slavery, by this strange proposal that we should
abandon the religion of all our fathers—men far more
excellent than we—a religion which has always been
advantageous to Norway. Through the great love which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>we bore thee, we conferred on thee the privilege
of introducing new laws. The code of laws which
thou hast this day proposed, and which we have
promised to maintain, we shall all of us inviolably
maintain. All of us will follow thee as our leader,
and honour thee as our king,—while any one of us
shall live,—so that thou wilt proceed moderately, and
ask not from our love what we cannot lawfully grant.
But if, as now seems to be the case, thou not only
requirest this change from us, but art preparing to force
our inclinations to it, know that we have all determined
to abandon thee, and to choose another king, under
whose sway we may be permitted to observe a religion
so dear to our hearts.” The good sense of this reply
might have been despised by Hako; but the menace
was to be regarded, when it was received with applause
by the assembled multitude. This was a critical moment,
and Sigurd, whose authority, alike from his dignity
and character, was so great, now came forward. As
soon as the tumult had subsided, he assured them that
the king wished what they wished, and that the good
understanding between them would never be destroyed.
The people replied,—“Then let king Hako do as his
father did,—offer sacrifices to the gods for abundance
and peace!” When the assembly was dissolved, Sigurd
besought the king to reserve his intention of proselyting
for more suitable times, and, above all, not to incense
nobles and people by refusing some show of compliance
with what all had demanded.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c017'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>942
to
956.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The proceedings which we are now relating doubtless
occupied many years, though, by most historians,
they have been crowded into three or four. We are
told that the above assembly, in which the laws of Hako
were passed, was held in 941; and we know that, in
956, he was still labouring for the introduction of the
new faith. Hako, though he saw the prudence of complying
with Sigurd’s advice, was loth to follow it; probably
he hoped to discover some way of evading even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the slightest homage to the old faith. At the sacrificial
time, however, he was compelled to go to the temple;
nor could he avoid sitting on the throne, as president of
the ceremonies. The office of high-priest was performed
by Sigurd, who, after filling the cup, delivered it to the
king for consecration to Odin. As Hako received it,
he drew upon it the sign of the cross,—a thing never
seen before, and highly disagreeable to all present.
“How is this?” cried a chief; “does the king refuse
to consecrate, and sacrifice to the gods?” A tumult
arose; but it was allayed by the philosophic Sigurd, who
observed that Hako had consecrated to Thor, by making
on the cup the sign of that deity’s mallet. The following
day he was present at the festival. The people
insisted that he should taste of the horse-flesh,—he
refused; that he should drink from the consecrated cup,—still
he refused; that, at least, he should taste the
gravy which flowed from the roasted meats,—he hesitated.
The temple was in an uproar; and violent hands
were about to be laid on him, when Sigurd interfered,
and said that the king would do what was amply sufficient
to satisfy the gods,—he would hold his head over
the caldron, the handle of which he would touch with
his lips, and inhale the fumes arising from it. Accordingly,
the monarch approached the caldron, and was
observed to cover the handle with linen before the application
of his lips; he then inhaled the odour, and
returned to his seat gloomy and discontented, but not
more so than many of the spectators. The following
year, when the yule festival, the most important of all,
was to be celebrated, and the people of Drontheim
were assembled together, with eight of the princely
pontiffs, Hako could not avoid attending. These had
agreed, not only that they would pluck up by the roots
what little Christianity had yet been planted in Norway,
but that they would force the monarch to sacrifice
with them. In conformity with this resolution, they
had destroyed three Christian churches, and killed three
priests. On the first day of the sacrifices, which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>celebrated in the great temple of Moria, Hako was peremptorily
required to join in the rites. By the authority
of Sigurd, the demand was so far modified that,
if he would eat of the horse-flesh, and consecrate all
the horns presented to him, he would satisfy the audience.
He did so; nor did he, as before, make the hated
sign of the cross, in offering the mead to the gods.
This was guilty condescension, and he felt it: he felt,
too, that he had done wrong to be present; and his
anger was excited against both Sigurd and the whole
pagan population of Drontheim. He vowed to be revenged,—to
fall on the inhabitants with an armed force,
as soon as spring appeared.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>956

<p class='c009'>When Hako was preparing to put his menace into
execution, intelligence reached him that the sons of his
brother Eric had descended on the coast of Vikia, defeated
king Trygve, and were laying waste the whole
province, which they were likely to subdue. To oppose
the common enemy was now his object, and that
of his chiefs. Even the eight pontiffs, who had been
so deeply offended with his contempt of their religion,
joined him: they preferred the yoke of a mild Christian
to that of cruel pagans, as the sons of Eric were known
to be. All hastened to the southern coast, disembarked,
and joined in the battle. It was hardly contested; but,
in the end, victory declared for Hako: with Guthrum,
the eldest of those princes, he fought hand to hand, and
killed his antagonist. Many fell; the rest hastened to
their ships, and took refuge in Denmark, where they
were sure of a favourable reception from Harald Blaatand.
They were pursued, indeed, by the victor; but
they had the advantage in celerity. In consequence of
this invasion, which would, probably, be repeated, Hako
revived an ancient law for the protection of his coasts,—a
law once general in the north, and adopted by our
Saxon kings. It divided the kingdom into maritime
districts, each extending from the sea-shore as far as
the rivers could boast of salmon; and each compelled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>furnish a certain number of vessels and men in proportion
to its extent. In each district, these ships were
always to be so far ready, that, when an enemy appeared
within sight, they should, before he could reach
the coast, be prepared to receive him. That the alarm
might be communicated from one district to another,
huge trunks of trees were placed on the summits of the
mountains, and formed into piles, so as to be converted
into huge watch-fires whenever the occasion demanded.
They extended from the extreme angle of the south, to
the remotest elevation of the north. Yet these wise
precautions were of no avail when the sons of Eric, at
the head of a powerful Danish armament, and of such
piratical vessels as they had been able to engage, next
appeared off the southern coast. The watch-fires were
not lighted; and the progress of the hostile fleet was
unknown to the king until it was near at hand. The
cause of this negligence is very imperfectly explained.
Snorro says that the signal fires were always to begin in
the east,—as if pirates could not land in the west or
north!—and run in a line to the extreme south, then
northwards, to the extremity of Norway. He adds that,
as the watchmen who should give a false alarm would
be severely punished, they were loth to light these beacons
until they were sure of an enemy’s presence. Probably
the ships stood out too far from the coast to
be descried by the naked eye; perhaps some of the
pagan sentinels were more inclined to the restoration of
Eric’s sons than to the sway of a Christian prince;
perhaps, too, there was bribery. Great was the astonishment,
greater still the dread, of king and people,
when the armament anchored in Ulfasund. Both were
unprepared; and the first idea of Hako was to retire
into the north until he could be joined by vessels and
men sufficient to resist the invaders: but one of his
officers, who had often fought with king Harald, dissuaded
him from this prudent step. The king’s father,
he observed, had never considered the number of the
enemy; he had fought with many and with few, yet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>on all occasions, had won the battle. This was imprudent
advice; for though, in the present case, Hako,
being unexpectedly joined by a considerable force, defeated
the enemy, and slew one of Eric’s sons, the adventure
was a rash one, was purchased with much loss,
and might have ended fatally. That similar negligence
did lead to a fatal result, will soon be apparent to the
reader.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>958
to
963.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>That, on two successive occasions, the same negligence
should be shown by the watchmen, and the same imprudent
advice followed by the king, may induce, in
the reader’s mind, a suspicion that Snorro has confounded
the two. Hako was quietly seated at table, in one of
his manor houses in the little island of Stord, off the
coast of Hardaland, when a domestic entered to say that
many vessels, which had a suspicious look, were in
sight. The king and his guests, rushing out of the
house, were satisfied that a hostile armament was actually
approaching. It was led by Harald, who, since the
death of his brother, was the eldest of Eric’s surviving
sons. Hako, and the chiefs who happened to be with
him, hastily collected all the men in the neighbourhood
and advanced to repel the invaders. The battle engaged,
and was, as before, desperately disputed. Hako
performed his duty nobly: two champions of the enemy
were soon laid at his feet; and the pirates were again
put to flight, but not until Hako had received a mortal
wound. He was carried on board a vessel, because he
wished to be taken to one of his manors in the north;
but the blood, which no art could stop, flowed so plentifully,
that his cure was not expected. On reaching
the manor he loved,—that in which he had been born,—he
called his friends around him, and acquainted
them with his last wishes. As he had only a daughter,
Thora, he declared the sons of Eric his heirs; and
despatched a messenger, both to acquaint them with
this news, and to request that they would be merciful
to his adherents,—to all, especially, who were bound to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>him by the ties of consanguinity. “Should my life be
spared,” he added, “I will leave my throne and country,
embrace the monastic life, and endeavour to atone
for my numerous offences against God. If, as I feel,
I shall die among pagans, bury me in whatever manner
you please.” Soon afterwards, he breathed his last.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From the tranquillity which Hako enjoyed in regard
to his subjects during the last years of his life, we may
infer that he had abandoned the hope of converting
his people. It has been affirmed that he became at
least half a pagan. This statement is abundantly confirmed
by his dying words; by the fact that he was
buried according to heathen rites; and by the universal
belief that his soul ascended to the hall of Odin. On
this subject we have the confirmation of a pagan bard,
who describes the joy of the warrior god and his chiefs
at the arrival of the Norwegian monarch.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><sup>[194]</sup></a> It was,
probably, as much for his religious indifference in the
last years of his life, as from any other reason, that he
was thus honoured. Yet all Norway bewailed him;
whatever his faith, his virtues could not be mistaken;
and the epithet which he so well deserved—that of
Hako the Good—rendered his memory dear to his
country. During his reign it enjoyed extraordinary
abundance; robberies and violence were suppressed;
the laws which he found in use he caused to be administered
with vigour; and the new ones which he promulgated,
and to which we shall advert in the proper
place,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c017'><sup>[195]</sup></a> show that he was far superior to his predecessors
in his care of the internal tranquillity.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Harald</i>, surnamed <i>Graefeld</i> or Grey-mantle, the
eldest son of Eric and Gunhilda, was now declared
monarch of Norway. But the title had in it more of
pomp than of real power. In the first place, his two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>brothers had also the regal title, and were placed over
the central provinces of Norway. Then the eastern
provinces were subject to the kings whom Hako the
Good had placed over them; namely, Trygve, the son of
Olaf; and Gudred, the son of Biorn. Nor was this
all; for so popular was jarl Sigurd with the inhabitants
of Drontheim, that they awarded him the privileges,
though not the title, of king. Here, then, were
five chiefs invested with the regal functions, and independent
of one another; and, with the exception of
occasional tributes, of Harald himself. This division
of power could not be pleasing to Harald, who hoped
one day to unite the scattered fragments of the monarchy;
but for some time he was compelled to act
with great caution. He acknowledged the authority of
the three kings who were not his brothers, on the
condition of their holding from him as they had formerly
held from Hako the Good. But if even he had
been sincere in these steps, the ambition of his mother,
who shared in the councils of all her sons, would have
led him to retrace it. She often represented to them
that they had the title but not the power of kings;
that if Trygve and Olaf enjoyed their kingdoms by
hereditary claim, surely Sigurd, who was only a jarl,
had none, and that to remove him would be an act of
good policy. Harald replied that to remove so popular
a chief “was not quite so easy as to kill a calf or a
kid.” There were other ways, she rejoined, of effecting
this object, than by open force. Sigurd had a brother
who had not been raised to either wealth or consideration,—probably
because he was unworthy of
either,—and he was easily induced, by the promises of
the king and of Gunhilda, to enter into a plot against
the life of Sigurd. To throw the intended victim off
his guard, extraordinary professions of friendship and
splendid presents were transmitted to him by Harald.
His motions were closely watched; and one night,
while at one of his rural manors, with fewer attendants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>than ordinary, he perished in the flames of his own
house. But the royal assassins reaped no advantage
from this crime; for the inhabitants of Drontheim
elected Hako, son of the deceased jarl, to the vacant
dignity; and Harald, himself, was compelled to sanction
the election. To fortify himself against the vengeance
of the reigning family, Hako entered into a secret
alliance with the two kings of the south, Trygve and
Gudred. It did not escape the penetration of Gunhilda,
who again entered into a secret conclave with her sons.
The result was soon apparent. The royal brothers
proclaimed their intention of undertaking a piratical
cruise in the Baltic; and for this purpose, hastening
towards the southern boundary of Norway, one of them
invited king Trygve to join him. The latter accepted
the proposal; but in hastening to an interview appointed
by one of the brothers, he and twelve of his
companions fell beneath the hands of a much superior
band. While this deed was perpetrating, Harald,
himself, disembarked; and hearing that Gudred was
holding a feast at a house not far from the city, he
hastened thither, surrounded the house, and destroyed
both Gudred and his companions. The fruit of both
deeds was the annexation of these provinces to the
domains of the sons of Eric. But their vengeance
was not complete; for Harald, surnamed Grenske,
the son of Gudred, escaped first to the uplands, and
when his life was not safe there, into Sweden, where
he became a famous pirate.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>969
to
977.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner were these crimes perpetrated, than the
sons of Eric proceeded towards the north, with the
avowed purpose of destroying Hako. Knowing the
inferiority of his numbers, he betook himself to the
piratical life, but not until he had devastated the
central provinces subject to the sons of Eric. After
his departure Drontheim submitted to them; but small
was the advantage which they derived from this event.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>The next summer Hako returned; and though he was
frequently absent on piratical expeditions into the Baltic,
in winter he always commanded at Drontheim. Many
were his conflicts with the forces of Harald; and,
though sometimes defeated, he had always a sure
resource either in the support of the inhabitants of
Drontheim, or in his own ships. The sons of Eric
were not popular: one of them, soon after the departure
of Hako, dishonoured the bed of a noble chief,
and was killed for the crime. Throughout the annals of
this bloody period, we perceive the hand of retributive
justice: the man who had exercised violence became
its victim. Thus the treacherous brother of Sigurd,
the man who had betrayed that respected chief into the
hands of his murderers, was slain in battle by the hands
of Hako his nephew. Thus died Erling, another of
Eric’s sons. He was followed by his lustful brother: the
inhabitants of Drontheim, which during one of the
frequent expeditions of Hako he had seized, being
unable to support his rapacity, rose against him, and
sacrificed him to their just resentment. The fate of
Harald, himself, was not distant. Though, by the
destruction of two kings, the expulsion of Hako, and
the death of most of his brothers, he was, nominally,
monarch of Norway, he was unpopular. Nor was the
absent Hako negligent in creating him many troubles
from without. On Norway, ever since the days of Ragnar
Lodbrog, the Danish kings had cast a longing eye;
they considered it, no less than Sweden, as a portion of
their vast inheritance; and Hako had little difficulty
in persuading Harald Blaatand to aspire to the throne
of that kingdom. As the equipment of a naval force
would be expensive, and might be useless, it was
resolved to entice Harald of Norway into Jutland,
under the pretext of doing homage to Blaatand for the
fiefs which he had formerly possessed in Denmark, and
which were now to be restored to him. Harald,
credulous enough to believe the invitation sincere,
repaired to Jutland, and was soon compelled to fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>with the superior numbers of a chief who had been
secretly instigated to assail him. In that battle he fell,
fifteen years after the death of Hako the Good, and
thirteen from that of jarl Sigurd.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c017'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>977
to
978.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After this event, Hako and the Danish king, who
knew the advantages which they expected could be
gained only by celerity, sailed with a powerful armament
for Norway. Many were the exiles who accompanied
them, and whom the cruelty of Gunhilda and
her sons had forced to abandon their homes. Among
them was Harald Grenske, the son of king Gudred
who had been so treacherously slain by the Norwegian
brothers. On reaching Tunsberg, the Danish king was
joined by multitudes of the inhabitants, of whom all
were dissatisfied with the sons of Eric. The first care
of Harald was to reward his counsellor and friend,
Hako, whom he placed over seven provinces in the
west and centre of the kingdom, all to be held feudally,
as they had been held by the jarls of Harald Harfager.
There was, however, this distinction in favour of Hako,
that if the necessities of the public service should
require it,—if, for instance, the territory should be
invaded by an enemy,—he was at liberty to employ all
its revenues for its defence. Harald Grenske, being of
the royal blood of Norway, then eighteen years of age,
received the title of king, and with it Westfold, Vingulmark,
and part of Ayder. The rest of the kingdom
was confided to Sweyn, son of the Danish monarch, as
the viceroy of his father, who was hailed as the lord
paramount of the whole. Gunhilda, with her two
surviving sons, fled to the Orkneys, and Harald of
Denmark retired to his own capital.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c017'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>978
to
988.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In his very dreams Hako could scarcely have anticipated
the prosperity which was now his lot. His
father had been only the jarl of Drontheim; his own
life had been perpetually hunted by the sons of Eric;
he had been an exile for many years; yet he was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the ruler of seven provinces, not removeable at the
pleasure of the Danish monarch, except by open force.
But he was not, says the historian, happy. His nights
were often sleepless; and when he did sleep, his
dreams were disturbed. It was not remorse which thus
rendered him anxious; it was ambition. That he
aspired to the sovereignty of all Norway, may, from the
time of Harald’s departure, be inferred from every
action. But many were his opponents or rivals, whom
he hoped time or chance, intrigue or revolution,
would remove. The first who troubled him in his
government was Ragenfrid, one of the surviving sons
of Eric. From the Orkneys, this chief, with a considerable
fleet, sailed for Norway. Hearing that Hako
was at Drontheim, he landed in the southern provinces,
and spread his devastations on every side. On the
approach of the jarl he hastened to his ships; in a
naval action he was victorious; but as he was unable
to contend with Hako on land, he proceeded to ravage
the coast wherever it was inadequately defended; and
in a short time he seized Sogne, Hardaland, Fiord, and
some other districts. The following spring, jarl Hako,
having collected troops on every side, renewed the war.
This time fortune did not desert him: he vanquished
Ragenfrid, whom he also expelled from Norway. His
next wish was to remove Harald Grenske; but he was
wily enough to wait for time and circumstances. The
same time and circumstances, he trusted, would release
him from all dependence on the Danish court. At
first he forwarded the stipulated revenues to Harald;
but he soon sent a portion only, or withheld them
entirely, on the plea that the defence of the country
required them all. But he had no wish prematurely to
offend that monarch; and when required to assist in the
war against the emperor Otho, he served personally in
the war. The issue was not prosperous: Harald, as
we have before related, was compelled to receive baptism,
and Hako to follow the example. But he was
still a pagan; and he resolved that the missionaries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>with whom he was to return into Norway, should never
see that country. He therefore landed them on the
Swedish coast, and after wasting Gothbed with fire and
sword, proceeded to his favourite Drontheim. There,
and wherever he had the power, he restored paganism
to its ancient splendour; nor would he tolerate Christianity.
This conduct was offensive to Harald; but
that monarch had other wrongs to avenge. The jarl
not only refused the accustomed tribute and proclaimed
his independence, but ravaged the coasts of Jutland.
Harald retaliated on those of Norway. His purpose
was to subdue Iceland, with the sarcastic poets of which
he was offended; but he had more solid reasons for the
conquest than those assigned by the chronicler. That
island, like the Orkneys, was the resort of pirates whenever
they were defeated in Scandinavia. His desire to
explore the state of Iceland before he invaded it has
given rise to a legend which may be mentioned for its
novelty. He persuaded a wizard—no doubt a Finn—to
change his form, and repair to that island. No form
seemed so judicious as that of a large fish; and under it
the magician made the voyage, without the incumbrance
of ships or men. But his ingenuity availed him little.
On attempting to land at the first bay, a huge dragon
forced him to seek the deep. At another, a large bird
equally opposed his landing. If the east and north of
the island were thus guarded, surely the west coast,
which was then, as now, wholly unfrequented, would
be more accessible. The hope was vain; a fierce bull
advanced into the water to meet him. Nor was the
southern coast more hospitable: as he attempted to
land he perceived a huge giant, whose head was higher
than the hills, and whose hand was graced with a ponderous
bar of iron. To attempt the conquest of a region
guarded by local deities, or by extraordinary magic, was
hopeless; and the baffled Finn returned to Denmark.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>900
to
993.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>So long as Harald lived, Hako appears to have remained
undisturbed; but, after the accession of Sweyn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>a powerful fleet sailed from Denmark to chastise his
rebellion. Yet it entirely failed; patriotism roused the
Norwegians to unite, and repel the invaders. As yet,
too, Hako had shown few proofs of that unbridled
licence which distinguished him in the following years.
He had many great qualities; he was active, enterprising,
brave in a degree seldom equalled, even in an
age of heroes. Great was his triumph over the formidable
Sweyn; and he had no longer a rival, except
in Harald Grenske: nor did this king long thwart his
views. The way in which Grenske met his fate has
in it much of romance, yet is in no respect contrary to
probability, or inconsistent with the manners of the
times. In a piratical expedition to the Baltic, he landed
on the Swedish coast, of which kingdom Olaf, son
of Eric the Victorious, was the head. In his youth
Harald had been reared in Sweden; and his foster-sister
was Sigfrida, mother of the king. Hearing that
Harald was on the coast, not far from her manor, she
sent him an invitation to visit her, and he readily accepted
it. Never was hospitality more open or more
agreeable. The widowed queen, who sat on a throne
to honour Harald and his chiefs, presided over a sumptuous
entertainment; and, after it, she encouraged the
circulation of the horn, not merely by her invitation,
but by her example. “All drank manfully,” says the
historian, which means deeply enough. But neither the
lady nor Harald indulged so much as the rest; and when
the latter was laid in the magnificent bed which had been
prepared for him, the queen entered his apartment, horn
in hand, and challenged him to drink more. At length
both were intoxicated, until Harald was overpowered
by sleep, when Sigfrida went to her own couch. The
next day the entertainment was renewed; but this time
both hostess and guest were moderate. Love had entered
the heart of Harald, but he durst not declare it;
and after some time he took his leave, and returned to
Norway. But he could not rest; and when spring
came, he revisited the Baltic. Affection had made him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>timid; he durst not, unbidden, go to the house of Sigfrida,
and he requested an interview on the sea-coast.
She rode to the place, and Harald, dismissing his attendants,
mentioned his passion. It found no response
in her heart. He had, she observed, a good wife already.
The king rejoined, that Asta, his queen, was
no fit match for him; that she was much inferior in
birth. “That may be true,” replied Sigfrida, who was
believed to possess some knowledge of futurity; “but
at this very moment she is pregnant of a son, who will
be a great honour to you both.” She then departed as
she had arrived, on horseback, leaving Harald in much
despondency. Unable to desist from his hopeless suit,
he again repaired to her palace, and found another royal
suitor. As before, the entertainment was good; but,
in the ensuing night, both kings were destroyed by their
hostess. The fleet returned to Asta without its leader.
She immediately repaired to her father’s house in the
uplands, and gave birth to a son, whom she named
Olaf, destined to become the sainted king of Norway.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Hako, now the sole ruler of all Norway, was, like
many other princes, unable to resist prosperity. The
love which his people—at least, the inhabitants of
Drontheim—had long borne him, had changed into
hatred, by the licentiousness of his conduct in his declining
years. The daughters of his noblest chiefs he
forcibly brought to his palace, and, after a few days,
returned them to their families. Murmurs arose; but
they were disregarded by the hoary idolater, who thought
his power too well established to be shaken. But he
was at length roused from this dream of security, by
the report that there was a descendant of fair-haired
Harald, unequalled for valour, who probably aspired to
the throne of his ancestors. This was Olaf, the son of
Trygve, whose adventures are the most romantic in the
history of the North.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c017'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>969
to
970.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the death of Trygve, Astridda, his widow, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>was then pregnant, fearing the vengeance of Gunhilda
and her sons, fled to an island in the solitary lake of
the uplands, where, in 969, she brought forth a son,
whom she named Olaf, after his grandfather of that
name. There she remained the whole summer, accompanied
only by her foster-father, and two or three
domestics. But when the days began to shorten, the
cold breezes from the lake were too much for Astridda
and her child; and, accompanied by the same faithful
domestics, she left her island home. To escape observation,
she never came within sight of human habitation;
and when, after many days, she approached her father’s
habitation, she was too cautious to enter. A messenger
acquainted him with her arrival; and he met her at a
solitary hut in the forest, where every domestic comfort
was supplied her. Two maid servants only, with her
foster-father, his child, and her infant son, formed her
whole establishment. It was fortunate for her that,
during this winter, Gunhilda and her sons were too
closely occupied by Hako, the jarl, to have leisure for
pursuing her. But that ambitious woman had heard
of Olaf’s birth; and when spring arrived, she sent her
spies to inquire into the truth of the report, and where
both mother and child might be found. Their inquiries
were successful; and a chief, with thirty horsemen, was
despatched to bring the infant to the court of Gunhilda.
Eric, however, the father of Astridda, was told their purpose
when they were only a few miles distant from the
house. It was nightfall; and he led his daughter, with
her precious charge and a few domestics, into the forest,
where he acquainted her with her danger, with his inability
to protect her, and with the necessity of her
hastening, in the most secret manner, to the house of
an aged friend in Sweden. No sooner had she departed,
than he returned to his own house, to await
the arrival of the horsemen. Fortunately, both for him
and his daughter, they did not immediately call upon
him, but passed the night at a neighbouring house. The
following morning, when he was asked where his daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and grandson were, he denied that they were with
him; and, on their refusing to believe him, he allowed
them to search every corner of his habitation. But the
leader of the band was at length informed of their route,
and, causing his men to mount, he pursued it. Darkness
overtaking them, they passed the night with a rich
landowner, whom they carelessly asked whether he had
seen a woman with a child pass that way. He replied,
that a woman and child, in very mean attire, with other
persons equally humble, had besought his hospitality,
and that he had refused to lodge them,—for, like
worthies of recent times, he had a great dislike to beggars,—but
he believed they were at some cottage in the
neighbourhood. And so they were;—at the cottage of
an honest farmer, and less distant than was suspected.
But Providence watched over the safety of mother and
son. While this conversation was passing, a peasant
in the employment of that farmer accidentally called at
the rich man’s house, on his return from the forest to
his master’s. He heard all that had passed; and, ignorant
of Astridda’s arrival, communicated it to his master.
The Norwegian, as prudent as he was humane, perceiving
that the third part of the night was already
past, went to his guests, who were fast asleep, and told
them, in an angry voice, to rise and leave his house.
They tremblingly obeyed; but no sooner were they
beyond the inclosure, than he acquainted them with the
cause of his seeming harshness. He sent them to a
solitary lake, on which was an island covered with reeds,
and bade them remain concealed until they saw him
again. As the water of the lake was shallow, they
easily waded to the island, and concealed themselves,
while Thorsteim (his name shall not be buried in oblivion)
returned to his own house. As he had foreseen,
on the following morning the chief of the horsemen,
after inquiring at many houses, called at his, and inquired
after the fugitives. “They have been here,” was
the reply; “but, before the break of day, they both left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>me, and went into the wood.” Nor was he unprepared
for the next question,—whether he would be their
guide in searching for the mother. He readily consented;
and, as may easily be conceived, led them in a
direction exactly contrary to that which they had pursued.
Nor was this all. On the pretext that they
should probably be more successful if they separately
continued the search, he left them, but only to delude
them by new expedients. The day was thus wasted,
and the horsemen returned to Gunhilda. That evening
Thorsteim went to the island, provided the fugitives
with a store of provisions, and, what was much better,
with a faithful guide. Astridda pursued her journey,
and, without any further interruption, reached the house
of Hako the Old, by whom she and her infant were
affectionately received, and with whom they remained
about three years.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c017'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>964

<p class='c009'>But the fortunes of Olaf and of his mother were still
to be singular. They had not long enjoyed the hospitality
of Hako, when Gunhilda sent an embassy to Eric,
king of Sweden, to obtain possession of the young prince.
Under the specious promise of amply providing for one
whose fortunes she pitied, and the fate of whose father
she had long bewailed, her messenger easily prevailed
on Eric to send an escort to the house of Hako for the
prince. But, at the court of Eric, Hako had a son, who
was present when the affair was mentioned to the king;
and he gave his father timely warning of the Norwegian’s
approach. The Swedish noble was therefore
prepared for his visitor. After the display of much
ceremonious politeness, the ambassador mentioned the
anxiety of Gunhilda to educate young Olaf in a manner
becoming his birth; and begged that the royal child
might be confided to his care,—a request in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Swedish king joined. “Astridda,” replied the wary
Hako, “is the mistress of her own actions, and if she
consents to thy proposal, I can have no objection to it.”
On the refusal of Astridda, the disappointed ambassador
returned to Eric’s court, and obtained a stronger force,
with the intention of removing the child by violence,
should entreaties be unavailing. As before, Hako was
prepared, and he was less complaisant than on the
former occasion. “Astridda,” was the substance of his
reply to the renewed proposal, “has no great reason to
confide in the promises of Gunhilda; she knows her
wiles, her deceit; she is still averse from thy proposal;
and the boy cannot go without the mother’s consent,
nor shall I allow her inclination to be forced, so long as
she continues under my protection.” High words
arose; the ambassador threatened to employ force;
Hako replied, that men more powerful than he would
fail in such an attempt. The dispute reached the ears
of a cowherd of Hako’s—a huge herculean man—who,
seizing a pitchfork, hastened to the scene, and said,
“Is it thou who darest to insult my princely master in
his own house? Choose one of these two things,—either
speedily retire from this neighbourhood, or prepare for
thy death by this pitchfork, which will be equally fatal
to thy companions!” The ambassador and his suite
hastily retreated, and on their return to Norway acquainted
the disappointed Gunhilda with the ill success
of his journey.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c017'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Whether through fear lest king Eric should, in the
end, force her son from her, or through the desire of
seeing her brother Sigurd, who was then in high favour
with Waldemar, a king of Gardarik<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><sup>[205]</sup></a>, Astridda left the
hospitable roof of Hako. By him she was confided to
the care of some merchants who traded with Gardarik,
and supplied with everything necessary for her voyage. In
the Gulf of Finland they were taken by Esthonian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>pirates, separated, and sold. Olaf, Thorolf, and the
son of Thorolf, became the property of one who, seeing
the old man past service, put him to death; the two
boys were afterwards sold to different masters, and
Astridda sent nobody knew where. Subsequently, the
same master purchased Thorgils, the foster-brother of
Olaf, and employed him in the meanest drudgery. But
the prince was not thus treated; he was soon beloved
by the old pagan, and beheld in the light of a son. It
happened, one day, that Sigurd, the uncle of Olaf, came
to the master’s house, and saw the boy, then about ten
years old, playing with others of his age. He saluted
Sigurd; the latter returned the courtesy, and was immediately
struck with the foreign countenance of the
boy. In answer to his questions, the boy told him his
name, and the names of his parents. Sigurd at once
recognised his nephew, whom he redeemed; but the
boy would not go with him unless he was accompanied
by Thorgils, who was redeemed at a lower price. To
the honour of the pagan master of Olaf, it must be
added, that he would not have sold the boy, unless
Sigurd had given a pledge that he should never be
resold, and that he should be treated as well as he
had been under his own roof. Both children were
taken to the court of Sigurd’s master, who reigned in
the vicinity of Novgorod. The attachment which Olaf
bore to his friends was equalled by his hatred to his
enemies, and to the enemies of his friends. One day,
as he stood in the public market, he perceived the merchant
who had killed Thorolf: approaching with much
deliberation, he drew his little sword, inflicted a mortal
wound in the head of the merchant, and immediately
ran to acquaint his uncle with the deed which he had
performed. Apprehensive of the consequences, Sigurd
led his nephew into the presence of the queen, and besought
her protection; and through her influence, a pecuniary
compensation was received by the relations of
the deceased. He soon became a favourite at court;
the king, learning his royal birth, placed him among his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>nobles; and nine years passed away with rapidity.
Every accomplishment becoming his descent and his
future prospects was acquired by him. Among these
was piracy, to which, from his twelfth year, he was
habituated. In it he acquired considerable reputation
during the following years; and was most useful to the
king by destroying other piratical vessels which disturbed
the peace of Gardarik, and by the rich treasures which
he brought from his frequent expeditions. But his
favour with the king had the ordinary effect,—it created
rivals and enemies; and he left the court to do what so
many of his ancestors had done before him,—to pursue
his fortunes on the deep.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c017'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>985
to
994.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the shores of the Baltic the young chief obtained
much celebrity, alike for his valour and success. He
was consequently joined by many piratical vassals, until
he had a considerable fleet under his command. Towards
the close, he caused his vessels to anchor in a
bay on the coast of Pomerania, which was then governed
by a princess, the daughter of duke Borislaf, whose
husband was lately deceased. The fame of his exploits,
of his accomplishments, of his personal comeliness,
reached her ears, and through her minister she sent him
an invitation to pass the winter in her capital. It was
readily accepted; and the natural consequence followed,—her
marriage with the pirate chief. Invested by
this union with the military government of the state,
Olaf defended the rights of his consort much more
eagerly than those of her subjects. Some territories
and fortresses which had been dismembered from the
duchy, he restored to it. But in one of these warlike
expeditions, he was nearly a victim to the bad faith of
the barbarians. Leading his troops against a fortified
town which had thrown off its allegiance to the princess,
he pressed the inhabitants so closely that they offered
to submit to his discretion, and opened their gates to
receive them. No sooner, however, had a few of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>men entered with him, than the ponderous barricades
were closed, and he was assailed by a multitude. But
a sea king never lost his presence of mind. Commanding
his followers to imitate his example, he repaired to
the walls, fighting as he retreated; and on reaching
them, he leaped to the ground outside the fortifications.
The place was now assailed with the vigour
which exasperation always gives; it was soon carried
by storm; the garrison were put to the sword, and
the walls levelled with the earth.—But this humble
sphere was too narrow for his ambition, which the
events then passing in Norway served to inflame. In
about a year after his marriage, he sailed with a small
number of vessels to the coast of Sweden, ravaged
Scania and Gothland, took one or two prizes, assisted
the emperor Otho in the invasion of Denmark, and in
the victory which the temporal head of Christendom
obtained over the pagan Dane, and was present at the
deliberations which preceded the restoration of peace.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
That he was half a Christian—at least in disposition—is
evident from the relation of his biographer; but
where he had acquired the little knowledge he possessed
of Christianity is not so clear. His biographer affirms
that he had often heard of the Christian doctrines,—which
may be true enough; but we cannot subscribe
to the next assertion, that one reason of his esteem for
the new faith was, a miracle which he had seen archbishop
Poppo work in presence of Otho and Harald of
Denmark. However this be, he had a great aversion
to idolatry; and, even at the court of the pagan king in
Gardarik, he had always refused to sacrifice to the gods.
In the army of Otho he met with his father-in-law,
duke Borislaf; and after the successful termination of
the war, he returned into Pomerania. But his restless
disposition would not long permit him to remain with
his bride; and he led another expedition to various
shores of the Baltic. After the death of his consort,
which happened in three years after his marriage, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>would no longer remain in Pomerania. Probably the
event disposed him to humility, to reflection. However
this be, he was now better instructed in the principles
of Christianity,—whether in Greece, as his biographer
assures us, or in some Slavonian province where
Greek missionaries were labouring, is of little moment.
But the baptismal rite was not administered to him for
some years afterwards,—until he visited a hermit in
the west. He is said to have been instrumental in
the conversion, also, of his master, the king of Holmgard,
and of the queen. Whatever his zeal might
be at this period of life, at a subsequent one, as we
shall soon perceive, it was great enough. But his
religion was, like that of the period, a strange one: it
did not deter him from ravaging the coasts of Christian
countries, from burning the huts of the poor,
and sacrificing the inmates. Years after his pretended
change of belief, he was occupied in this dreadful
profession, from the coasts of Russia to those of Brittany
and Ireland. In Ireland or in England,—probably
in the latter,—he is said to have married an
Irish princess, named Gyda; but before the ceremony
could take place, he was compelled to fight with a rival,
whom he soon vanquished. After this event, he was
sometimes in England, sometimes in Ireland, but every
where his fame as a warrior extended. The sea kings
of this period were accustomed to fight as much for
others as for themselves, by hiring their services to
any native prince who had need of them; nor did it
unfrequently happen that the northmen were, at the
same time, in opposite ranks. For such services the
wages were always abundant; sometimes in land, more
frequently in gold and rich merchandise. Nor must we
forget that, when on the coast of a friendly power, the
pirates exercised the profession of merchants, and traded
from one port or one kingdom to another, with more
regularity than we generally suppose. But this pursuit
was much too quiet for the sea king, and he followed it
from necessity only: his delight was in scenes of excitement—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>those of danger and carnage. Whether
in peace or war, no scruple was felt in stealing cattle
from any coast. While in Ireland, an adventure befell
Olaf which illustrates both this statement and his own
character. He and his men had disembarked on a
certain part of the coast, seized a multitude of cattle,
and were driving them towards their ships, when a poor
farmer ran after them, and begged the chief to restore
the animals which had been stolen from <i>him</i>. “Thou
mayst have them,” replied Olaf, “if, without impeding
our march, thou canst distinguish them from such a
multitude.” The man had a dog, which singled out
the animals, one by one, to the great amazement of the
chief. “Wilt thou part with this dog?” demanded
Olaf. “Readily!” was the answer; and Olaf, not
satisfied with restoring the man’s cattle, made him some
valuable presents.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c017'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>967
to
993.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In all his voyages, Olaf never despaired of being one
day able to procure the rights of his birth in Norway,
and his eyes were frequently turned to that country.
Nor was he without anxiety as to the fate of his mother,
of whom he had heard nothing since the day on which,
while yet an infant, he had been separated from her.
Her adventures may, for a moment, occupy the reader’s
attention. After remaining a slave for some time,
she was seen in Pomerania by a Norwegian pirate of
noble birth: at first he did not recognise her; where
health and cheerfulness and beauty had once been, he
observed paleness and melancholy; but there was, alike
in her appearance and manner, something that inspired
him with respect. A closer examination convinced him
that he saw Astridda, the queen of Trygve, before him;
he entered into conversation with her, and learned that
she was now on sale. She besought him to ransom her,
and return her to her friends; and he promised to do
so on one condition,—that she would become his bride.
Her situation was not one that admitted of either scruple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>or hesitation; she became his wife, and the mother
of several children. Year after year rolled away, and
the mother heard not of the son, or the son of the
mother. The fame of his exploits, indeed, had reached
Norway; but he had assumed another name,—that of
Olo, a native of Gardarik, and by it he was known to
all the princes of his time, from the imperial Otho to
the humblest piratical chief. But Hako, the usurper
of Norway, knew the truth; and as his favour with the
people, from his new vices, was now departing<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c017'><sup>[209]</sup></a>, he
began to look with much anxiety towards Ireland, where
Olaf had for some time been. To remove this aspiring
rival was necessary to his safety; and he immediately
devised the means of carrying his design into execution.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c017'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>995
to
996.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Intimately connected with Hako was a piratical chief,
Thorer by name, a man of enterprise, who had acquired
reputation on the deep, and who would not hesitate to
execute any commission with which he might be entrusted.
This man was the fittest instrument for alluring
Olaf into the power of Hako. By open force,
no chief could hope to succeed; for Olaf was followed
by some of the most noted heroes of his time, and
was at the head of some ships. He must therefore,
if possible, be brought to Norway; or, as a last
resource, assassinated. As the deceitful representations
which Thorer was enjoined to make might not have
their due effect on Olaf, two of his kinsmen, whom
he had never seen—the brothers of his mother—were
to be associated with him, and, if need were, to confirm
his statement.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><sup>[211]</sup></a> They revolted, we are told, at this
meditated treachery, and refused to share in it until
menaced with the loss of their own lives. However
this be, Thorer hastened to Dublin to put his design
into execution. To lull suspicion, he was provided with
abundant merchandise, which he was to barter in Dublin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>a port then flourishing for its commerce. He had
little difficulty in discovering the abode of Olo of Gardarik,
the only name by which Olaf was known. By
degrees, he cultivated the acquaintance of Olaf; and,
as he was a man of great observation, eloquent, and
specious, he was a welcome visitor. As usual, Olaf,
without naming himself, inquired after his family connections;—how
many were living, what their condition
in life, what their influence with the public. When
satisfied on these points, he inquired into the character,
the power, the reputation of Hako. “The jarl,” replied
Thorer, “is a great prince, absolute in everything, and
no man dare contradict him; but, if I must speak confidentially,
he is tolerated only because of old Harold’s
race no scion remains whom the people might choose
in lieu of him. Many are the nobles, the chiefs, the
warriors, the people, who would rush to the standard of
such a rival, if one were to appear in Norway. But
why talk thus vainly? no prince of that house survives.”
Such was the manner in which Thorer fulfilled
his commission; and we cannot be surprised that, after
a few interviews, Olaf opened his heart to the traitor.
He was not, by birth, Olo of Gardarik,—he was Olaf, the
son of king Trygve; and might he, indeed, hope that
the Norwegians would accept him, in preference to
Hako? Thorer solemnly affirmed that, if he but showed
himself to the people, the reign of Hako would be at
an end. He did more; he professed the warmest interest
in the fate of his new friend, whom he exhorted
to sail, without delay, to his native country. With five
ships only—for why engage many where none would
be needed—the prince, accompanied by Thorer, left
Dublin, passed the Hebrides, and at length reached the
Orkneys. The jarl of these islands was Sigurd, who
welcomed the strangers: but in Olaf he found a master.
The prince, already assuming the rights of sovereignty,
commanded the jarl to receive baptism, and, on his
hesitation, threatened him with death if he refused. The
choice was not difficult, and the Christian church had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>one hypocrite more. Homage, too, was done to the new
king; and, as a pledge of fidelity, Whelp, the son of
Sigurd, accompanied Olaf to Norway.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c017'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>995
to
996.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Olaf reached the coast of Agder, he learned
that the inhabitants of Drontheim were conspiring against
the authority of Hako. This news was a thunderbolt
to Thorer, who, from the gratitude which the Norwegians
had evinced towards the jarl, for his recent
victory over the Jomsberg pirates, had regarded his
dynasty as secure. The present discontent, however,
might pass away; and he determined to assassinate
Olaf: but the men whom he had hired for that purpose
betrayed him to the prince, and he fell the victim of
his own wiles. Olaf, whose name had not yet been
mentioned to the people, now hastened towards Drontheim,
where every moment added to the critical situation
of his enemy. Nothing can so well describe the
character of Hako as his conduct just before and at this
period. Though he knew that the inhabitants of that
province were only waiting for an opportunity of banishing
or destroying him, he persevered in his lustful
course. Wives, daughters, sisters, widows, virgins,—all
on whom he cast his eyes, were, however nobly
allied, forcibly taken to his residence. But the following
incident had happened before the arrival of Olaf:—Brinjolf,
a noble of Ganlardal, had a beautiful and accomplished
wife; one night, while both were in bed,
the myrmidons of Hako arrived at his villa, and unceremoniously
informed him that his wife was wanted
by the jarl, and that she must accompany them. On
his indignant refusal to suffer her departure, they returned
for more assistants, and bore her away to the
palace of Hako. The following day Brinjolf put on his
armour, rode into the neighbouring country, assembled
his connections and friends, laid before them the indignity
which he had received, and prevailed on them
to unite in his cause. They did not, however, break
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>out into open insurrection, but they entered into a conspiracy
to assist one another when the convenient moment
should arrive. This event was no warning to
Hako. Soon afterwards, smitten with the charms of a
married lady, Godruna, who from her beauty was surnamed
the “Sun of Lunden,” he sent his emissaries to
her husband’s house to bring her to him. Under the
pretext of inviting them to supper, Orm, the husband,
detained them until his servants had collected a force
sufficient to set them at defiance. The lady herself then
told the messengers, in a tone of insult, that she should
not accompany them unless Thora, the favourite mistress
of the jarl, sent for her. Threatening vengeance
on the whole family, the men departed; and Orm lost
no time in sending out the arrow, the symbol of war,
to his kinsmen and dependents.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c017'><sup>[213]</sup></a> The well-known token
was rapidly conveyed; the gathering commenced; and
in a short time a formidable band was assembled, eager
to destroy the tyrannical jarl.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c017'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>995.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The motives of this rustic force were soon known to
Hako. His first object was to conceal himself until he
had collected troops enough to crush the insurrection.
What follows is exceedingly romantic; and we give it
as we find it in the authorities before us, leaving the
reader to exercise his own judgment in what he may
reject or admit. We may, however, observe that, if
some of the incidents have been too strongly coloured
by posterity, the substance of the relation is true.—Accompanied
by his domestics, Hako fled from his villa
into a deep valley, which has ever since borne his name.
As it was supposed that he would hasten to his ships,
which were at some distance along the coast, and were
under the guidance of his son Erleng, the paths which
led to the coast were more narrowly watched than those
in the neighbourhood of the valley. At nightfall, he
despatched some of his men to the station where his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>vessels lay, commanding his son to meet him off a more
southern portion of the coast; the rest he sent to their
own homes, keeping one serf only, Thermod Kark, who
had been his companion from infancy. Feeling that
his present retreat was not secure, he plunged further
into the solitudes. On reaching the banks of a lake,
which was frozen over, he dismounted, made a hole in
the ice, thrust his horse into the aperture, and left his
mantle beside it, so as to make his pursuers believe that
he had perished in the waters. He then crossed the
ice, and, with his slave, found refuge in a solitary cave
in the mountains. Both being much fatigued, they
soon fell asleep; but the slave started, and awoke his
master to acquaint him with an awful dream which he
had just experienced. He had seen a man of a dark,
dreadful countenance, approach the cave, stand for a
moment before it, and, after exclaiming, “One is dead!”
ascend the hill. This mysterious denunciation was
thought by Hako to allude to Erleng; for, after a moment’s
reflection, he said, “Thy dream appears to indicate
the death of my son!” The interpretation, say
the sagas, was a true one. Olaf had just arrived off the
coast; Erleng, with three vessels only, could not make
head against the superior fleet which he rightly judged
to be that of an enemy; and, to escape captivity, he
and a few of his companions, after approaching the
shore as near as they could, quietly descended into the
water, and began to swim. In this state they were overtaken
by the vessel in which Olaf was. According to
Snorro, it was Olaf himself who, with an oar, broke
the head of the young jarl as he was buffeting the
waters; according to Gunlaug, it was one of his mariners.
Both agree that Erleng perished within a few
yards of the coast; that many of his companions perished
with him; that the vessels became the prize of
Olaf, who learned, for the first time, the flight of
Hako, and the insurrection of the rustics.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>995.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After this dream, proceeds the Saga, the slave had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>another, which frightened him so much that he made a
distressing noise, like one afflicted with the nightmare.
Being awoke by his master, he said that he had seen the
same dark man approach the cave, stop at the entrance
as before, and say, “Tell thy master that all the passages
to the sea-coast, and the coast itself, are blocked
up!” The jarl thought his days were numbered; but
he said nothing. He would, however, no longer remain
in the cave; and both proceeded towards the villa inhabited
by Thora. When at a distance from it, he
despatched Kark with a request that she would secretly
meet him in the forest. She obeyed the summons, and
showed, by her affectionate behaviour, that whatever
are the crimes of men, women can be faithful to the
last. Hako asked her if she could furnish him with
some hiding place for a few nights. “That will be
difficult,” replied Thora; “my house will soon be
searched; not a corner of it will escape scrutiny, for all
people know I shall save thee if I can. Yet there is
one place where nobody would expect to find a prince
like thee—it is under the pig-sty.” They went to the
place; the slave enlarged the cave; provisions, lights,
and other necessaries were brought; and Hako, accompanied
by Kark, descended into the cavern. The earth
which had been recently dug up was removed; wooden
rafters were laid over the hole; over them straw and
dung were spread, and the swine were turned in to
tread down the covering, so as to confound the recent
marks. In addition, the entrance to the sty was
blocked up by a large stone. Having taken these precautions,
Thora returned to the house, none of her domestics
being aware that she had seen the jarl. The
prisoners were, therefore, left to themselves; but how
they were to breathe in such a place, we are not informed.—The
enemies of Hako, with Olaf at their head,
soon arrived. They had found the mantle on the ice
of the lake, and had been induced to return, until suspicion
of the stratagem arose, and induced them to continue
the pursuit. On reaching the house of Thora,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>they broke open the doors, examined every part within
and without, and desisted only when search was manifestly
vain. If any faith is to be placed in either of
the authorities before us, Olaf, on issuing from the house,
sat on the very stone which blocked up the entrance to
the sty, and stimulated his followers to search in other
districts, by offering splendid rewards to any one that
should take or kill the jarl. His loud voice penetrated
to the cave where Hako and his slave sat; and, as the
former looked at the latter, he saw his countenance
change. “What means that look?” demanded the
master; “dost thou wish to betray me?”—“No,”
replied the other, “but I tremble at that voice; it is
the one I heard in my dream.”—“Both of us,” rejoined
Hako, who was very superstitious, and had often
consulted the oracles of the country, “were born on the
same day, and the same day will close the life of both!”
Towards nightfall Olaf departed, and the master and
slave were left to their own reflections, or what was still
worse, to their conversation. Hako durst not sleep, lest
his slave should assassinate him; nor Kark, lest the
same advantage should be taken by his master. At
length, however, the slave closed his eyes, and dreamed
that he and his master were in the same ship, of which
he was the helmsman. This required no interpretation;
as Hako observed, they were, indeed, in the same vessel,
and the fate of both was in the hands of the slave.
Again the latter dreamed: he was now at the court of
Olaf, who fastened a golden chain around his neck.
“That chain,” observed Hako, “will be a bloody one
to thee, if ever thou comest into the presence of Olaf;
it portends thy doom: yet be faithful to me, and all
will be well!” At length nature was too much for
both, and they slept; but, towards the break of day, the
slave was awoke by the horrid noise made by his master,
who seemed as if in a cruel nightmare, as if struggling
with some nightly demon, or with his own evil genius.
Kark arose, drew a knife from his belt, and cut the
throat of Hako. The head he then separated from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>body, and hastened with it to Olaf, who was now
proclaimed king. “What led thee to this deed?”
was the demand of the prince. “Chiefly,” replied the
slave, “the great reward which I heard thee offer,
and partly the confusion of my senses at the condition
of Hako.”—“Thou shalt have the reward,” rejoined
the king; “but thou shalt also die. If Hako
was a bad man, he was still thy master, and a benefactor
to thee; and thy fate must be a warning to thy fellows,
not to lift their hands against those whom they ought to
defend.” The slave was then beheaded; and the prophecy,
that he and Hako should die within a day of
each other, was literally fulfilled.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c017'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Thus perished the son of Sigurd,—a man of great
talents, great enterprise, and, until the last few years of
his life, of great public utility. Previous to that period,
his enemies could not deny him noble birth, great
valour, consummate prudence in the art of government,
and success in war. He was, besides, liberal to his
dependents, and magnificent to his friends. His chief
defects were dissimulation, treachery, falsehood; a superstitious
regard for the pagan religion, and a hatred
of Christianity. Formerly, he had been called Hako
the Good; he was henceforth to be called Hako the
Bad. He died in his fifty-eighth year, thirty-three of
which he had exercised the sovereign power under the
title of jarl.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>996.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The death of Hako enabled <i>Olaf Trygveson</i> to take
possession of the whole kingdom, as fully as had ever
been done by fair-haired Harald. The people, indeed,
would hear of no other king. One of his first objects
was to introduce Christianity; and he commenced with
Vikia, the province where his mother (the wife of Lodin)
and all his family connections lived, and where he
knew he should find the least resistance to his efforts.
To his friends he expressed his resolution, either to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>convert the whole kingdom, or to perish in the attempt.
Having first prevailed on his numerous family connections
to embrace Christianity, and to promise a cordial
co-operation in his designs, he called an assembly of
the province, and, like most royal missionaries, intimated
his command, rather than his request, that all should
receive the baptismal rite. The chiefs, whom he had
previously secured, immediately signified their assent,
and their example constrained the multitude. Here, as
everywhere else, if any refused to forsake their old faith,
he would not condescend to argue with them; some he
exiled, some he mutilated, others he put to death. This
was a sure method of producing outward obedience to
the new religion; and, in one year, the whole of Vikia
was—not christianised, but baptized. Accompanied
by a strong force, the royal missionary next transferred
his labours to Agder and Hardaland. Here, the same
alternative was proposed,—conversion or death; and the
smaller evil was naturally chosen. Rogaland was the
next province to benefit by his apostolic efforts, and
they had the usual success. It appears, however, that
the inhabitants were less inclined to the novelty than
their countrymen of Vikia; and three of the leading
chiefs were besought to answer the monarch in full assembly.
But who would venture to resist the king,
especially when he denounced the severest vengeance on
all who should refuse to obey him? One of the speakers
was suddenly seized by a cough; another began to
stammer; the third had conveniently a sore throat; so
that no answer being returned to the most gracious
message from the throne, silence was taken for consent,
and all present were within a few days hurried to the
baptismal font. In one province the assembled chiefs,
who were all kinsmen, promised to embrace the new
religion on this condition,—that one of their number
should receive the hand of Astridda, sister of the monarch.
At first the princess, who had forgotten the
humble fortunes which had lately been the lot of all her
family, refused the match, as beneath her dignity; she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>wanted a prince. Olaf adorned her own hawk in magnificent
plumes, and sent it to her, with an intimation
that it was no less easy for him to ennoble the humblest
peasant in Norway. The ambitious lady then consented;
the province became Christian; and Erling, the brother-in-law
of Olaf, became a powerful jarl. Proceeding
northwards, the royal apostle assembled the inhabitants
of the Fiords and of Raumdal. On this occasion, a
whole army was with him; doubtless because he apprehended
more opposition than he had yet encountered.
But his mode of argument was too convincing to be
resisted;—“Receive baptism, or fight me!” and the
easier alternative was selected. From this meeting he
repaired to Laden, where there was a magnificent temple
of the gods: the idols he despoiled, threw them to the
ground, and consumed the building by fire.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>997
to
999.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But if this coercive mode of proselyting was, in many
places, immediately effectual, it was not so in all. So
enraged were the inhabitants of Raumdal at the destruction
of the temple at Laden, that they sent forth
the arrow, and an armed multitude rose at the summons.
But Olaf proceeded to the south, where they
could not follow him, and there he passed the winter.
This opposition only rendered him the more ferocious
against the pagans and all their superstitions. In the
next assembly over which he presided, he denounced
the magicians, and caused a decree of banishment to
be pronounced against them: if they did not voluntarily
leave the country, all were to be arrested, brought
before him, and put to death. Eyvind Kella, a descendant
of Harald Harfager, was at the head of a college
of magicians. These the king invited to an entertainment,
and set fire to the house in which they were
assembled. Eyvind, however, was not there; but he
was afterwards taken, with a considerable number of other
proficients in the art, and were thrown from a high
rock into the sea.—Olaf, like all the men of his time, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>a believer in these pretended arts; and he was sure that,
unless they were repressed, religion must suffer. His
people were not less superstitious than he; and they
doubted not that he had personally to contend with Odin
himself. One evening, as he was holding a festival in
the retired manor of Augvald, an old man, with a high
cap like one of the Persian magi, and only one eye, was
admitted to the table. So eloquent was his discourse,
so varied his knowledge, that Olaf was delighted with
his guest. Many were the abstruse questions which he
put to him; equally wise and ready were the answers.
Thus the night wore away. At length Olaf asked the
stranger who was that Augvald to whom the house in
which they were had once belonged, but who had long
been dead. Augvald, replied the guest, had a cow, to
which he paid divine honours, which always accompanied
him, and supplied him with milk. At length he fell in
battle, and in the neighbourhood of this house was buried,
in one tomb, while the cow was buried in another.—Still
the night wore away, and the stranger showed no desire
to go: at length the king pulled off his clothes, and
laid down on the bed, the mysterious guest being seated
before him. But the bishop entered, to inform the
king that it was time to sleep; and at the sight of him
the guest departed. The rest of the monarch, however,
was short; he could not sleep; and to pass away the
time he sent for the stranger, who was nowhere to be
found. The morning following, he inquired of his
cooks and butler whether they had seen him. They
replied that a man answering the description had
appeared amongst them while they were preparing the
feast; had asserted that the meat they were cooking
was of the worst kind, and unfit for the royal table;
and had presented them with two noble barons of beef,
which he had assisted them to prepare. In great consternation
Olaf ordered what remained to be thrown
away; the stranger, he was sure, was no other than
Odin, who had some deep purpose in view; but never
would he be the victim or the instrument of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>fiendish designs. The gravity with which such adventures
are related by Snorro is the best illustration of
the opinions and intellect of the times.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>998.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But Olaf had seen more sturdy antagonists than
wine-bibbing deities. Repairing to the north, he found
that his attempts to convert the people were not always
to be successful. To the states of Drontheim, which
he had convoked at Froste, they repaired, all armed,
and evidently intent on some important measure. After
the assembly had been legally opened by Olaf, he commanded
this people to embrace the Christian religion.
A great clamour arose; and the people did what they
had never yet dared—assert their superiority over
him, command him to be silent, and threaten that, if he
refused to obey, they would drive him from the kingdom.
They had overpowered Hako, the godson of
Athelstane, and they did not think Olaf in any respect
superior to that monarch. The tone of Olaf was soon
altered; he saw that the formidable body, who had been
raised by the fatal arrow, could not be resisted on this
occasion; and he expressed his wish to live on the best
terms with all his people. In reply to their next demand,
that he should join in the sacrifices, he promised
to be present on the next great solemn festival, and then
choose which religion he would follow. By this promise,
and by his unusually placid manner, the wrath of
the people was disarmed; and it was agreed that they
should meet him at Laden, in the province of Moria.
In the interval he prepared for the struggle. With a
stronger force than he had yet brought to such assemblies,
he proceeded to Laden. Before the business of
the meeting was opened, he gave to the assembled
people a magnificent entertainment, and all drank
deeply, so as to become intoxicated,—the usual result
of all northern feasts. The next morning, after the
legal opening of the Thing, he arose, and thus addressed
them:—“Countrymen! you well know what passed
in the last assembly at Froste, and that we are here met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to restore the pagan sacrifices which you so much
desire. You also know with what contumely I have
treated the gods,—how often I have thrown them to
the earth, and burned their temples, and defied them to
their faces. Now, according to your own creed, such
deeds can be only forgiven by extraordinary oblations.
If I must sacrifice, I will, as the chief pontiff, select
such victims as I may approve. They shall be <i>human</i>
victims,—yea, and the noblest amongst you!” With
much solemnity, and in a most emphatic manner, he then
mentioned the names of twelve chiefs,—the noblest in
Norway, who were all present,—that were to be immediately
immolated; and he called on his followers to
lead them into the temple. The result may be anticipated:
the terrified chiefs who were thus doomed, and
all who feared the same fate, left the matter of religion
to the king—they would no longer oppose him: the
multitude were constrained by their example; and both
the high and the low, young and old, were led to the
baptismal font.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>998.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Encouraged by the success of this policy, Olaf now
hastened into Drontheim, where the provincial states were
assembled. Here, however, he experienced the same
opposition. The people insisted, not only that he should
leave them to the undisturbed exercise of their worship,
but that he should, without delay, join in their sacrifices.
Accordingly he entered the temple, accompanied
by some of his own party, and of theirs. The chief
idol, Thor, was seated in much barbaric grandeur, being
covered with gold and precious stones. Olaf gazed for
a moment; then, seizing a ponderous mallet, he struck
the idol with such force that it reeled from the pedestal,
and fell heavily on the floor of the temple. This was
the signal for the rest of his followers, who, with the
rapidity of lightning, hurled the remaining gods from
their seats, with shouts of derision. At the same time,
the leader of the opposition, a noble pontiff, was killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>outside the temple. Olaf then addressed the multitude,
and left them the choice whether they would be baptized,
or fight him. They were willing enough to
choose the latter alternative; but having no chief who
could lead them on, they yielded, and were immediately
regenerated in the sacred font. For their good behaviour
in future, they were compelled to give hostages.
To conciliate the family of the deceased pontiff, Olaf,
who was now a widower, married Gudruna, the
daughter; but he had soon to separate from her,
since, on the first night of their nuptials, she attempted
his destruction.—Olaf was not yet satisfied; the districts
north of Drontheim, especially Halogia, were
yet pagan; and he longed to convert, that is to baptize,
the natives. When any of them, by accident, or stress
of weather, touched in the ports of Norway, he hurried
them away to the miraculous font; or, if they refused
to go, he punished them for their obstinacy. Eyvind,
a native of Halogia, furnishes an illustration of the
manner in which the royal missionary attempted the
conversion of individuals. Being brought into the presence
of Olaf, he was exhorted to embrace Christianity;
but he refused. Mild, persuasive language, in which
the bishop (and there was always one in the royal precincts)
joined, was at first adopted; but without success.
Olaf then offered him large domains, to be held
by the feudal tenure; still no assent. “Then,” added
the enraged apostle, “thou shalt die!” A chafing dish
of burning coals was brought, and laid on the belly of
the pagan, whom death soon released from suffering.
To avert the odium which must attach to the deed,
a report was spread that, before his death, Eyvind had
acknowledged that he was an evil spirit in the human
form.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c017'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>999.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When the favourable season arrived, Olaf, with a
large band of armed men, proceeded into Halogia to
convert the people. In the south of that province they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>were unprepared for resistance, and the good work was
unusually prosperous. But two chiefs in the north,—Raude
and Thorer,—both zealously attached to paganism,
both rich and powerful, equipped ships to oppose
him. They were defeated; and Raude, who was a great
magician, raised a wind by which he escaped. Not so
Thorer, who was driven to the shore: though, from his
swiftness, he was called <i>the Stag</i>, he could not outstrip
the Irish dog, Vikia, which Olaf despatched after him.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c017'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
Turning round, he wounded the animal; but a spear
from Olaf entered his side. The victor now hastened
after Raude, who had found a refuge in the island of
Godey; but the magician raised such a tempest that
there was no approaching the island. At the end of a
week he proceeded farther to the north; and, after a
successful course of preaching, again returned to the
coast opposite to Godey. Still the elements raged. “What
shall we do?” demanded the king, of Sigurd the bishop;
“Defy the tempest,” replied the other, “and the demon
who has raised it!” Saying this, Sigurd arrayed himself
pontifically, took his seat at the helm, held out his
censor smoking with incense, raised a huge cross, recited
the gospel with many prayers, and sprinkled the ship
with holy water. The effect was miraculous: where the
vessel was there was a calm; on each side of it, the
billows rose furiously. During the passage, the same
wondrous phenomenon was seen: before them the sea
was smooth as glass; to the right and left the tempest
remained unabated. On reaching the bay, a huge dragon,
that is, a ship, stood on the sands. Olaf heeded it not;
but, hastening to the house of Raude, he bound the magician
with fetters, killed some of the domestics, and
captured others; and the same fate was inflicted on the
military companions of the chief. Raude was then invited
to receive baptism; if he did so, he should not be
despoiled of his substance. Not only was the invitation
spurned, but heavy curses were uttered on the king and
his faith. This was not to be endured; and the royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>missionary determined that this wretch should leave the
world by a novel death. Raude was fettered and gagged;
a serpent was brought to his mouth, and attempts made
to force the animal down his throat; but it recoiled in
affright. A horn was then passed between the magician’s
teeth; the adder entered at one end, passed through the
mouth into the stomach of Raude, and speedily ate for
itself a way out again. Great was the spoil which
awaited the victor: but his greatest pleasure was to execute
such of the magician’s dependents as refused baptism.
After these notable exploits, he returned into
Drontheim.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>998.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Though Olaf was as much disposed to enforce the
conversion of individuals as of large bodies of men, he
was not equal to both tasks; and, in the former case, he
sometimes devolved on others the important duty of a
missionary. A story preserved by Gunlaug, the Icelandic
monk, will illustrate the manner in which he
exacted revenge when his efforts had been unsuccessful.
Halfrod, the royal poet, was accused to Olaf of being
still idolatrous in heart, and of worshipping a little
image of Thor, which he carried in a bag. The accuser
was Kalf, another domestic of the palace. The poet
being summoned into the royal presence, indignantly
denied the charge; and, in proof of his innocence, turned
the bag in question inside out. “After this charge,”
said the king, “you cannot both remain in the same
house; let Kalf return to his farm.” Turning to the
poet, whose sincerity he probably wished to test, he
said, “Halfrod, thou must be my emissary to the uplands.
There resides a man called Thorleif the Wise,
who will not be converted. Formerly, I sent many
persons to reason with him, but they had no influence
over him. Now, I send thee, with an order either to
kill or blind him: take with thee as many men as
thou pleasest.”—“This commission,” replied the poet,
“scarcely becomes a freeman; yet I will go wherever
thou commandest. As my companion, I will take thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>uncle Jostein, with twenty-two horsemen.” Away they
rode; and, on reaching the wood near to the dwelling
of Thorleif, they dismounted. Halfrod, who knew that
the number of his followers would be insufficient if force
were required, said to them, “I will go alone to Thorleif’s
house; wait for me here three days; and if, at the
expiration of that time, you see me not, return to your
homes.” He would not permit even Jostein to accompany
him. His first care was to disguise himself so
completely that no eye could recognise him. In a
mendicant garb, his face discoloured with the appearance
of squalid wretchedness, he took his staff, and,
when near to the house, began to move slowly and
wearily, as if consumed alike by age and misery. Thorleif
was sitting on a bench, in front of his house; the
poet dragged himself along, and saluted him. “Who art
thou?” was the demand of Thorleif. Halfrod told a
piteous tale of his wanderings, his misery, his ill luck,
his dangers: he had been so unfortunate as to be seized
by the domestics of king Olaf, and hurried into the
royal presence. As usual, conversion or death had been
set before him; but he had escaped, and had, ever since,
been the sport of the elements. He thought, however,
that if he had continued rest, and good living, he should
be restored to a portion of his former vigour. “Fame
says that thou art liberal, and I hope thou wilt be so
towards me.”—“Of the truth of thy story,” replied
Thorleif, “I cannot judge; but if thou art an old man,
thou must have seen much and learned much: but thy
tongue runs somewhat smoothly for one so decrepit.”
If the poet was not old, he had travelled enough
to answer the questions of Thorleif. “There is a
man,” proceeded the latter, “at the court of Olaf, by
name Halfrod, of whom I have heard much.” Probably
Thorleif began to suspect that the poet was before him;
he knew that he should not long remain in peace; that
his refusal to embrace the new religion must bring on
his head the vengeance of Olaf; for, he added, “No
doubt the emissaries of Olaf will soon be here.” In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>reply to his question concerning Halfrod, the pirate had
a ready answer. He then, as if wholly exhausted, leaned
on the bench, and the moment he saw Thorleif off his
guard, he seized him with rapidity, and with a giant’s
strength; but Thorleif struggled, and they both tumbled
on the ground, the poet uppermost. In another moment
one of Thorleif’s eyes was out of its socket.
“What I have long foreseen,” said the pagan, “has
now happened. I doubt not that the king has commanded
thee wholly to blind or to kill me; I pray
thee, however, to leave me the use of the other eye, and
I will give thee rich presents.”—“I cannot accept thy
gifts,” replied the poet, who had more fits of generosity
than less tuneful minds, “but I will leave thee that
eye, and take the responsibility upon myself.” He then
arose, and returned to his men in the wood; nor did
Thorleif display his misfortune until they were far
enough from the neighbourhood to defy pursuit. But
if Halfrod was sometimes generous, he was also vindictive.
As they returned by the farm of Kalf, he said
to Josteim, “Let us kill this man!” The other refused;
but the poet rejoined, “It is not just that we
should blind a good man, yet leave this wretch uninjured.”
Saying this, he went to Kalf, who was throwing
the seed into the ground, seized him, and put out
one eye. On reaching the palace, Olaf inquired what
he had done. “I have made Thorleif blind.”—“That
is well,” rejoined the king; “show me the eyes!” In
the hurry of the moment, the poet produced the one of
which he had deprived Kalf. “This is not Thorleif’s
eye,” observed the king; “thou hast done more than I
commanded thee.” The other was produced. “This <i>is</i>
Thorleif’s eye,” said the king; “now tell me all that
thou hast done.” Halfrod did so, and was pardoned.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c017'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The success which through life had attended this
extraordinary man did not continue to the close. On
his separation from Gudruna, he sought the hand of
Sigrida, surnamed the Imperious,—the Swedish princess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>who had destroyed Harald Grenske. She accepted
him; many gifts passed between them; and an interview
was appointed on the limits of the two kingdoms.
Among the gifts was a huge ring of gold, which Olaf
had taken from the temple of Laden. Two goldsmiths
declaring to her that the metal was not pure, she caused
the ring to be opened, and perceived that the interior
was of brass. Indignant at the discovery, she declared
that it was only one in many cases where she had been
deceived by the king. Yet, at the appointed time, she
met him, and the marriage was arranged. But Olaf
insisted that she should renounce paganism, and receive
the baptismal rite; but she refused to do either; and
observed, with some wisdom, that as she should not
interfere with his worship, she had a right to expect
that he would not constrain her conscience. But the
royal preacher was not fond of opposition; he called the
queen by the most opprobrious epithet,—worse than an
old heathen hag,—threw his glove in her face, and
both separated for ever. Sigrida was not of a temper
to bear this insult, and her future life was given to revenge.
When, on the death of Gunhilda, daughter of
Borislaf, a duke of Pomerania, Sweyn of Denmark, became
a widower, she accepted the hand of that monarch,
with the view of hastening her revenge. At the same
time, Borislaf sought the hand of Thyra, sister of Sweyn,
a young and beautiful princess, who, however reluctant,
was forced by her brother to marry him. By this union
she became entitled to the domains which her sister-in-law,
Gunhilda, had enjoyed in Pomerania. But she
detested the old pagan and his court. During the first
week of her nuptials she abstained from food; on the
eighth evening, accompanied by her foster-father, she
hastened to a ship which was lying off the coast, embarked,
and was landed in Denmark. Knowing, however,
that, if her brother saw her, she should be sent
back to the court of Borislaf, she concealed herself until
a vessel was found to convey her to Norway. By Olaf
she was well received; and, in a few days, she became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>his bride. By what casuistry he, who preached Christian
morals to his subjects, reconciled to his conscience
this double adultery,—he, the husband of Gudruna,
marrying the wife of Borislaf, or how she, who also professed
Christianity, consented to the match,—we need
not inquire. History, which deals with facts rather than
motives, has now to relate, that this scornful rejection
of one princess, and this illegal marriage to another, led
to the destruction of Olaf.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c017'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>999
to
1000.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner was Thyra the wife of Olaf, than she began
to complain of her poverty. She had only what her
husband was disposed to allow her, which, though equal
to her wants, did not suit her dignity as queen of Norway.
Yet, in Pomerania, she had ample possessions,
which, if restored to her, would enrich her, and make
her no longer burdensome to him: Borislaf, she was
sure, would, if asked by Olaf, quietly surrender the domains.
By degrees, she prevailed on him to equip a
fleet for the coast of Pomerania. In the summer of the
year 1000, he departed on this expedition. On the
confines of Sweden, he married his sister, Ingeborg, to
Rognevald, a prince of that nation; and then, proceeding
on his voyage, soon reached the coast of Pomerania. In
the mean time, the arts of Sigrida prevailed, and
Sweyn resolved to join the enemies of Olaf. Actuated
by ambition, no less than by the hope of revenge,
he wished to obtain some portion of a kingdom which,
before the time of Halfdan the Black, had frequently
been subdued by his ancestors; and to punish Olaf for
presuming to marry his sister without his consent. Nor
had Sigrida much difficulty in prevailing on her near
kinsman, Olaf of Sweden, to join her husband in the
war. Eric, the exiled son of Hako the jarl, whom Olaf
had succeeded, and who had always found a welcome
home in Denmark and Sweden, acceded to the confederation.
But a more formidable opponent still was Sigvald,
a pirate chief of Jomsberg, whose close connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>with the Danish court has been related.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c017'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Sigvald was
the more dangerous from his treachery. So far from
openly declaring war against the Norwegian, he met
that monarch, for whom he professed the highest esteem,
and whom it was his object to detain on the coast of
Pomerania, until the united forces of Denmark and
Sweden arrived to crush him. At length, when he knew
the hostile fleets were in the Danish islands, he persuaded
Olaf to return, the office of pilot being intrusted
to him. With his own ships—which were eleven in
number—in the van, he led the Norwegian fleet into
the midst of the enemy, who lay concealed near the
present Stralsund. Not all the ships, however, were
there; some had taken to the open sea; so that Olaf,
with only a portion of his armament, was suddenly
assailed by overwhelming numbers of the enemy. With
his usual gallantry he defended himself, and great was
the carnage which he made among the hostile ranks.
But the contest was too unequal; the valiant champions
of Norway fell round their master; the Long Serpent,
as the ship of Olaf was called, was boarded by the son
of Hako; a desperate struggle on the deck followed;
and when few of the Norwegians remained alive, Olaf,
with three or four of them, plunged into the sea, and
was seen no more. Such, at least, is the relation of
Snorro, which is supported by reason; but the two
Icelandic biographers of this king—Gunlaug and Oddur—insist
that he saved himself by swimming, repaired
to the coast of Vinland, in Pomerania, was cured of his
numerous wounds by the sister of his first wife, went
on a pilgrimage to Rome, and, after many years, died
in the Holy Land.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c017'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>From the space which we have devoted to the exploits
of Olaf, his character may be easily inferred. The
sagas add, that he exceeded all men in two bodily qualities,
which are very rarely combined,—strength and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>agility. On one occasion he is said to have climbed a
steep precipice to extricate one of his courtiers, who had
ascended to a great height, and could not move upwards
or downwards: taking him under one arm, the
king descended with him safely to the plain below.
With both hands he was equally expert. One of his
amusements was to toss three sharp swords into the air,
and catch each by the handle as it descended, and,
without intermission, again to throw them, singly, far
above his head. This game is supposed to be of Indian
origin; and, probably, Olaf is the only king that ever
played it. He was fond of poetry, especially that which
commemorated the deeds of heroes; he was liberal to
all his dependents, accessible to all the world, jovial in
temper. His attention to commerce was one of his most
useful qualities; and whatever arts he had seen practised
in other countries he introduced into his own.
He founded, at the mouth of the river Nid, a city which
was long called Nidross, but the name was afterwards
superseded by that of Drontheim, from the province
that contained it. In ship-building, navigation, and the
arts dependent on them, he had no equal. But, to the
close of life, he was a barbarian: he indulged in habitual
drunkenness; and he shed blood so arbitrarily as
to prove that at no time, except when an assembly was
actually occupied in the public business, was he restrained
by law. He was, in the truest sense of the
word, a despot. Though a milder sovereign could not
have so completely triumphed over heathenism,—and
he was, therefore, of incalculable benefit to his country,
in removing an insuperable barrier to civilisation and
morals,—this fact does not in the least atone for his
ferocity. In many points, he bears great resemblance
to Peter the Great of Russia; though, in all good and
great qualities, he was inferior to that monarch. In his
reign many important voyages were undertaken; and to
these we shall advert in the chapter on the maritime
expeditions of the Northmen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1000
to
1012.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the death of Olaf, the two allied kings hastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>to divide Norway, or, at least, the greater portion of it,
between them. Their lieutenants were the two sons
of Hako the jarl, who had assisted them so effectually
in the defeat of Olaf. The administration of these
princes is mentioned with respect by Norwegian and
Icelandic writers. Though some of the local jarls
were oppressive, <i>they</i> were no tyrants; and, though
Christians by profession, they did not persecute, but
left the progress of their faith to time and reason.
Twelve years they exercised the government, when
Eric received a summons from his liege superior,
Sweyn, king of Denmark, to aid that monarch in the
final conquest of England.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><sup>[228]</sup></a> Leaving his son Hako, then
about seventeen years of age, with the administration of
the government, and confiding the youth to the mature
counsels of Einar the Archer, he sailed, with all the
force he had been able to collect, for the coast of England,
never to return. But a rival was now to appear
on the scene, before whom his own power and his
brother Sweyn’s was to dissolve into air.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c017'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In a former page<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><sup>[230]</sup></a>, we have related the tragical fate
of Harald Grenske, who did not live to see the birth of
his son, Olaf the Saint. Fearing the vengeance of
Hako the jarl, then ruler of Norway, Asta, the widow
of Harald, no sooner heard of his death than she
repaired to her father’s house in the uplands, where she
brought forth her son. Under her father’s roof the
child felt not the loss of a parent. Though she married
a second time, his education was not neglected.
Sigurd Syr, the second husband, was an easy, good-natured
man, whose time was wholly occupied by
his immense estates, and who left the instruction
of his step-son to one better qualified for the task,—Rane,
one of the favourite chiefs of the deceased
Harald. As Olaf was destined to be a saint, miracles
enough are recorded of his infancy, and of the period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>which preceded it. These, as we are arrived at the
historic period, we shall omit. Great praise is bestowed
on the precocious talents of young Olaf. To us they
appear indicative of the spoiled child. One day, says
Snorro, Sigurd, being desirous to ride into the country,
commanded him to saddle one of his horses,—a menial
office, but one that the noblest youths were accustomed
to discharge. He brought a goat instead of a horse or
mule, properly accoutred, and with provoking officiousness
proposed to assist him in mounting. “Thus it
always is!” observed Sigurd; “any command of mine
becomes the subject of ridicule.” In the military
exercises of the age Olaf was a proficient. He could
bend the bow, or dart the spear, or handle the sword,
with as much dexterity and as much strength as any
youth of the province; and in swimming he had few
rivals. Nor was he less attentive to the manufacture
and repair of armour,—a very necessary accomplishment
to a warrior, and especially to a king, at a time
when smiths were not numerous and were seldom at
hand. Of Christianity he acquired as much knowledge
as could be expected, when the priests, themselves,
were ignorant of its leading doctrines, and when its
purest rites were alloyed by superstition and heathenism.
His godfather was no other than Olaf Trygveson,
after whom he was named.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c017'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1007
to
1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Olaf had reached his twelfth year, which was
the seventh after the death of his godfather, he was
sent on his first piratical expedition, under the care of
Rane, his preceptor. On this occasion he assumed the
title of <i>king</i>, which was given to all sea captains who
were sprung from a royal family. The coast of Denmark
and Sweden were the first to experience his
ravages; yet why in time of peace—when in addition
Norway was dependent on both kingdoms—this should
be permitted, is not explained. We do not read that
either Eric or his brother Sweyn attempted to throw off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the yoke. But at this lawless period, when pirates of
all nations, from Ireland to Russia, swarmed on every
coast, it would have been impossible to discern the
author of the depredations, and, if they had been
known, to punish them. Besides, the subjects of one
power were as guilty as those of another; and where
both kings were equally injured and equally aggressive,
neither had a right to complain. To Sweden, in particular,
Olaf bore a strong hatred. In that country his
father had been murdered, and revenge was his first
duty. On the southern coast he fought his first battle,—not
against the Swedes, but against other pirates.
These he subdued; and, emboldened by his success, he
succeeded to the eastern shores, disembarked in the
vicinity of lake Meler, and recommenced his depredations.
To chastise his presumption, the Swedish king
put an armament in motion; but he escaped, and
returned home in triumph. When spring arrived,
he renewed his piracy on the coast of Sweden,
and extended it to that of Finland. In the latter
country he experienced, say his biographers, what so
many had experienced before him,—the influence of
magic. Missiles from unseen hands were showered
upon his little band: with his spoil he retreated to the
shore, where, to prevent his embarkation, a furious
tempest awaited him; but he sailed, and his perseverance
triumphed.—As he grew in years, he naturally
grew in enterprise. The following season
witnessed his depredations in Jutland; the next, in
Friesland; the next, in England. But he did not come,
we are told, to fight against the Saxons; the Danes
were the objects of his hostility; and, as the ally of
Ethelred, he assailed them with vigour. It appears,
however, that he was sometimes the ally of prince
Canute, the son of Sweyn. Probably he was ready to
transfer his services from one prince to another, as the
tide of victory turned, or as he obtained a greater
reward from one than from another. He appears to
have been one of the ferocious monsters who, in 1012,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>destroyed Canterbury, and its good archbishop St. Elphege.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c017'><sup>[232]</sup></a>
“He was a leader of the army,” says
Snorro, “which consumed that city.” From this exploit
few could have predicted his future saintship; but
saints then, as more recently, were easily made. In
these troubled times, his object was to collect all the
plunder he could—whether from pagans or Christians
little concerned him. In France as in Finland, in
Kent as in Jutland, in Ireland as in Pomerania, his
sword was equally active and equally pitiless.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After the death of jarl Eric, and Sweyn king of
Denmark, Olaf ventured to Norway. As a prince, he
could not be without ambition; as a piratical chief, he
had based his trust in his own valour: and the present
conjuncture he justly considered as a favourable one for
his views. Eric was no more; Sweyn, his brother,
and Hako, his son, were not descendants of the revered
Harald Harfager; Erling, a brother-in-law of Sweyn,
was a tyrant; and the Norwegians were dissatisfied
with a foreign yoke. Yet in this voyage, in which two
vessels only accompanied him, his motive must have
been, not conquest, but the desire of ascertaining the
state of the popular mind. He landed on an island on
the western coast, where, hearing that Hako was in his
neighbourhood, with one vessel only, he resolved on the
bold enterprise of making that chief captive. It was
easily carried into effect, and Hako was brought into
the presence of Olaf, who admired the unusual comeliness
of his person. “All that I have heard of your
bodily qualities,” said Olaf, “is, I perceive, true; but
your family is again doomed to be the sport of fortune.”
“We have always been so,” was the reply; “nor we
nor our enemies have been her favourites; and so strange
are the vicissitudes of this life, that, for anything I know,
we may again be in the ascendant.” “If I pardon thee,”
added the king, “wilt thou engage never to bear arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>against me,—never to revisit Norway?” The jarl promised,
and was suffered to depart, with such of his
companions as chose to accompany him. By Canute of
Denmark, then in England, he was well received, and
intrusted with a share of the administration. Olaf,
therefore, was rid of one rival; but Sweyn and Erling
still remained. His next object was to visit his native
region, where his kindred and friends were ready to
receive him. As he passed along many individuals swore
fidelity to him; but the majority waited the issue of
events. The manner in which his mother received him
may illustrate the domestic economy of the times.
Hearing of his approach, she commanded her servants,
male and female, to prepare everything as for a distinguished
guest. Four women prepared the hall of
entertainment with benches, chairs, and cushions; two
strewed the floor with rushes; two laid out a large side-table
with drinking cups and horns, and a two-handled
jug filled with mead; two laid out the table; two
brought in the dishes that would be required; two
drew the beer; two were sent to fetch such things
as were not in the house; and the rest of the servants,
of both sexes, were occupied in the back court-yard.
To Sigurd, who was occupied in farming, such garments
were sent as became a king, and with them a
horse magnificently caparisoned. Four domestics went
to invite guests for the entertainment, such as should
do the more honour to Olaf. The rest of the servants,—those,
we suppose, whose duty it was to wait on the
guests, were commanded to put on their gayest apparel,
and “such as had none were to be supplied by those
who had.” The manners of the age and the character
of the man are equally visible in the reply of Sigurd to
the messengers of his wife, when urged to appear with
becoming splendour. “Asta has before now received
her friends with much pomp, but never has she showed
much respect to mine. On all occasions she exhibits
as much ambition as if the greatest advantage were to
be derived from her display; and I suppose we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>be required to pay the youth the same honours at his
departure as at his arrival.” He then alluded to the
charge of the entertainment,—to the umbrage which
the kings of Denmark and Sweden might take at it,—and
concluded by hoping that all would end better than
he feared. But Sigurd was a prudent man, and he
exhibited no such spirit in the presence of his wife.
Knowing that he must obey, he sat down while one
servant pulled off his agricultural vestments; another
helped him to draw on a costly pair of boots; a third
fastened the spurs; another held his mantle and cloak:
the addition of a helmet and sword transformed the
honest farmer into a noble baron. But he must not
alone approach the son of his wife. From his peasantry,
hitherto busy in the labours of the harvest, he selected
thirty as a kind of a body guard, and with them he
rode in silent dignity towards his villa.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Sigurd drew near his house, he perceived the
ensign of Olaf advancing in the opposite direction. The
prince, followed by a hundred companions, all in magnificent
costume, he kindly saluted, and invited to share
his hospitality. The mother received the royal guest
with a kiss; and freely offered him and his followers
all the worldly substance that she had,—her house, and
lands, and servants. Thanking both parents, Olaf,
with his chiefs, was led into the hall. The feast was
prepared, and Sigurd, who was invested with the regal
title, ascended the chief seat, which was at the head of
the table, and was much higher than the rest. But
Olaf did not visit his parents for idle parade; and in a
day or two after his arrival, he invited Sigurd, his
mother, Asta, and Rane, his preceptor, to counsel him
as to his future proceedings. In a discourse of some
length, he expatiated on his past dangers, on the rights
of his family, on his own claims to both the inheritance
of his father and of Olaf Trygveson; and expressed
his resolution to obtain empire, or to die. Sigurd, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>a prudent man, replied, that for one so young, and with
so few resources, he had entered on a rash path;
that to defy such men as the kings of Sweden and
Denmark was not the part of wisdom; that little
dependence was to be placed on popular applause;
that the present attempt was above his abilities and
his means. He concluded, however, by observing
that, if the other chiefs of the uplands—kings as he
called them—were favourably disposed to his cause, he
would not be wanting in the support which his fortune
might enable him to give; and he even proposed to
accompany Olaf in a visit to those chiefs. Asta, whose
turn it was next to advise, spoke like a true descendant
of fair-haired Harald. She advised him to persevere in
his undertaking; and added, that she would rather see
him in possession of empire, were he to enjoy it briefly,
as the son of Trygve, than that he should grow old, a
powerless king, like Sigurd. When this council was
over, Olaf and his father-in-law went to meet the upland
kings. “There were many at this period,” says
Snorro,—a proof that the destruction of the supreme
power by the death of Olaf Trygveson was hurrying the
kingdom into all the anarchy from which it had been
extricated by Harald Harfager. The sway of Eric and
Sweyn, sons of Hako, had been so mild, or rather so
loose, that the country was become again the prey of
numerous independent chiefs.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In the assembly of upland kings, Sigurd showed that
he was no enemy to the elevation of his step-son; on
the contrary, he exalted the valour, the enterprise, the
success of Olaf, in so many parts of Europe; and besought
them to assist him alike by their arms and counsel.
The first chief who replied was not favourable to
the proposed enterprise; his motive was evident: he
feared that if a monarch of vigour, such as Olaf promised
to be, ascended the throne of Norway, there
would soon be an end of the provincial kings. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>next voted for the insurrection. If they must have a
chief ruler, better was one of their own country and of
their own blood, than a Dane or a Swede. In the end,
many of the assembled princes, but not the majority,
offered him their aid on the condition of his respecting
their existing privileges. The states of the upland
province were next assembled: the claims of Olaf were
laid before them; the chiefs recommended it to their
support; and with one voice he was acknowledged
monarch of Norway. With three hundred armed followers,
he proceeded into the neighbouring districts;
and he everywhere found the people willing to acknowledge
him. He now hastened into Drontheim, the
suffrage of which, as he well knew, would influence the
rest of Norway. At his approach, the arrow was sent
forth, and the rustics assembled in arms; but he had
the address to draw them over to his own party.
Though naturally furious and irritable, he had sufficient
command over himself to control his bad passions; and
every one that approached him left him with a full
conviction of his exceeding good nature. As he drew
near Nidaros,—the present city of Drontheim,—Sweyn,
the son of Hako, prepared a vessel to leave the
port. At this moment, two of Olaf’s vessels were entering,
and Sweyn, to avoid recognition, steered farther
to the north, cut down some trees which were near the
coast, placed them by the sides of his vessel in such a
manner that he could not be seen, and boldly returned
through the bay, on his way to the north. The men of
Olaf saw the vessel, and, believing it to be a cargo of
timber, made no effort to detain it. Landing at Froste,
the seat of his government, which he preferred to
Drontheim, he counselled with Eric about the steps which
were now to be taken,—whether he should collect
forces and risk the fate of a battle, or have recourse to
policy. The result was, that he should, if possible, wait
until the yule festival, when so many thousands would
be gathered together, and made the umpires between him
and Olaf. But the course of events hurried both parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>on; they collected troops, and with a body of two
thousand proceeded towards Drontheim. About the middle
of the night Olaf was awakened by the news that
his outposts had discovered a strong hostile column approach.
Hastily rising from bed, the king took all the
provisions he could find, and, accompanied by a small
body of followers, went on board the vessels which lay
in the river. He had scarcely stood out to sea when
the army of Sweyn entered the city and set it on
fire.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1015.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>This, to Olaf, was an unexpected disaster, and it
was one that ordinary prudence might have avoided.
He now was under the humiliating necessity of retiring
to the uplands to acquaint his kindred that he had been
driven from his capital by the son of Hako. But he
was better received than he expected or deserved. Several
of the chiefs supplied him with men and provisions;
and Sigurd Syr, his step-father, showed as much zeal in
his cause as any of his blood, and more effectually served
him. When spring approached he repaired to Tunsberg,
where new forces daily joined him. On his part,
Sweyn, during the whole winter, was no less active in
raising ships and men, and he was equally successful.
The day before Palm Sunday, the two armaments were
off the coast of Vikia, near to each other. One hundred
vessels accompanied Olaf; those of his enemies were
not inferior in number. Early on the morning of Sunday,
Olaf, with the banner of the cross displayed from
his own ship, led the attack. The battle was long and
doubtfully contested: if Sweyn had a larger force, that
of Olaf was better disciplined. At length victory
declared for the king; many of the enemy submitted;
the rest fled. Among the latter was Sweyn, who
hastened to the court of his father-in-law, the king of
Sweden, to solicit reinforcements; while Erling remained
to harass the victor. From Sweden the jarl
never returned. The king offered him troops; but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>preferred a peaceful government in that country, until
the course of events in Norway were more favourable
to his views. After a piratical expedition to the coast
of Gardarik, he fell sick and died. From this time,
Olaf may be more truly called the monarch of Norway.
The people of Drontheim, who had been much attached
to the jarl, now transferred their allegiance to
him. Erling, indeed, held out another year, and some
of the smaller chiefs were tardy in the payment of tribute;
but when he submitted, there remained only the
two foreign powers who could trouble the king.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1016.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>After these successes Olaf began the work of legal
reformation. The laws which Hako the Good had
introduced were often neglected; some of them were no
longer applicable, and new ones were demanded by the
necessities of the people. The manner in which he
proceeded in this object evinces his good sense. At a
certain hour he met the wisest of his people as well as
the noblest,—the low as well as the high,—clergy and
laity,—all in whose judgment he could place any confidence.
He then caused one of Hako’s laws to be
recited, and asked their opinion of its justice no less
than its fitness. Sometimes it was rejected; but generally
some improvements were made in it by common
consent. At other times he propounded new ones; but
it may be doubted whether any of them were obligatory
until they had received the formal sanction of the Thing.
Ecclesiastical matters next occupied the royal attention.
Such portions of the canon law as were applicable to the
circumstances of a barbarous, half-pagan kingdom were
gradually introduced. His great object was to abolish
what yet remained of paganism—a religion which had
been considerably observed since the death of Olaf Trygveson.
He would not tolerate it; wherever his jurisdiction
extended he caused the temples to be destroyed,
and rude wooden churches to be built on their ruins.
Nor was he regardless of the spiritual wants of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Orkneys, Iceland, and other dependencies of his kingdom.
To them he despatched missionaries, and inculcated
on all the necessity of zeal, of perseverance,
of unwearied industry. His own conduct was, in
this respect, a lesson to his people. He rose early,
heard matins and mass before he entered on public
business or broke his fast. It was his regular
attendance on public worship which, more than any
other cause, led to his subsequent canonisation. He
was, indeed, the first of the Norwegian kings that
punctually observed the ordinances of religion. Hako
the Good was as well disposed; but Hako, as we have
shown, was compelled to revert into idolatry. Olaf,
the son of Trygve, was too fond of the mead cup, and
of continuing his potations into the silence of night, to
attend early prayers. The present Olaf was, therefore,
the first whom the clergy could decently canonise. Not
that he was without his faults. He was vindictive,
hasty, intemperate, exacting the severest vengeance
from those who disputed his commands, and not sparing
of human blood. Yet he was affable, indulgent to his
dependents, and liberal to such as he had reason to
esteem.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1016.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>That the kings of Sweden and Denmark should make
no effort to recover their Norwegian possessions, was
not to be expected. In about a year after Olaf’s accession,
two ambassadors, with a suitable retinue, arrived
at Drontheim from the former kingdom. On their
way, however, and immediately after passing the mountain
barrier, between the two states, they had endeavoured
to prevail on the rustic landholders to pay
tribute, not to Olaf, but to the Swedish king. Little
do the majority of any country care for the reigning
sovereign; the rustics of Norway no more than any other
people. They professed their willingness to pay the
foreign king, provided Olaf would not require the
same taxes a second time. This conduct was treasonable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>One of the ambassadors felt that it was so, and
proposed that they should return into Sweden; but,
constrained by the other, both proceeded to Olaf’s
court. Here the same man acted still more insolently:
he advised the king to become the vassal of his Swedish
namesake, for no inferior step could screen him from
the vengeance of a monarch so much greater than he.
The king so far restrained himself as to bid them depart
and announce to their master his willingness to meet
him on the frontiers of the two countries. They left
the palace, but soon returned, demanding, with much
insolence, to see the monarch, who was then at table.
The porters were commanded to drive them from the
door. This conduct, which could not have been borne
even by a private individual, was deeply offensive to
Olaf. When he heard that, instead of retiring into
Sweden, one of them remained in the provinces to
collect tribute, he sent a small armed band in pursuit of
them; and the ambassador, with his suite, were suspended
from a public gallows. To guard himself
against the vengeance of his rival, Olaf now went through
the whole of his kingdom, holding assemblies of the
people in every province, receiving the homage of all,
propounding new laws, and laying more solidly the
foundations of the new church. Finding that the
districts bordering on Sweden were claimed by that
power,—that the limits of the two kingdoms were not
observed by it,—he slew the governor of West Gothland,
the lieutenant of the Swedish king, who had been long
harassing the Norwegian subjects of the frontier. To
prevent all future mistake as to that frontier, he caused
a ditch to be dug, and a parallel mound to be raised
along the disputed line; and, to protect the colonists,
he remained there with a considerable force during the
whole of the following winter. To avenge these insults,
the Swedish king began to arm. He threatened to
subdue the whole of Norway, and to drive the sea king
into exile.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c017'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1017.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The proposals for peace originated with Olaf of
Norway; but they were long destined to have no effect:
the wrath of the Swedish Olaf was too great to be
allayed by ordinary negotiations. In 1016, an ambassador
departed on this mission; but so unfavourable
were the accounts which he received of the Swedish
monarch’s disposition, that he proceeded no farther than
the house of Rognevald, one of the most peaceful of the
jarls, or provincial governors of the kingdom. But he
had an Icelander with him, Hialt by name, who offered
to undertake the embassy, and to brave the wrath of
the Swede. Hialt was a poet, and his profession was
esteemed at every court of the north. Accompanied by
another poet, and also, like himself, a wit, he hastened
to the Swedish capital. By Olaf they were well received,
because he knew not the object of their journey.
Their love of the cup was so tempered by discretion,
that, while they were the boon companions of royalty,—in
those days every poet was,—they never lost sight
of the respect which it always exacts. After some
days, such was his familiarity with the king that Hialt
alluded to the subject,—not as one that <i>he</i> had undertaken,
but as one in which the interests of Sweden were
deeply involved. A peremptory command to be silent
afforded little hope of success: he was told that the
name of Olaf the Fat (such was the epithet of the
Norwegian monarch) was not even whispered at the
Swedish court. But Hialt persevered. Knowing that
a matrimonial alliance with the royal family of Sweden
was the highest ambition of the Norwegian Olaf, he
solicited the interest of Ingigerda, daughter of the
Swede. The princess readily accepted both the proffered
hand of Olaf and the delicate task of turning her father’s
mind to the subject of peace. One day, when Olaf
was in high spirits,—which, to do him justice, was
frequent,—she alluded to the policy of leaving Norway
to its own kings. The people were an obstinate people,
much attached to their own regal line, and if the conquest
were effected, it would not be enduring; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>on the opposite coast of Finland were regions which
had formerly belonged to Sweden, and which might be
easily subdued. The lady was rendered eloquent by
the hope of a husband; but she was immediately silenced
by the king. “So, Ingigerda, thou wouldst see
me lose Norway that thou mightest become the bride of
this Olaf the Fat? That day will never arrive; I will
conquer Norway.” Not daring to renew the subject,
she retired to acquaint Hialt with the ill success of her
interference. They could only await the course of
events, in the hope that the states of the kingdom which
had no private resentments to gratify would require the
king to make peace with his rival. Rognevald, at the
suit of Ingigerda, and from his attachment to Norway,
where most of his kindred abode, undertook to mention
the subject in the approaching assembly at Upsal; and
he had the address to interest in his behalf the venerable
Thorgnyr, the oracle of the law, the most influential
of the Swedish chiefs. After the assembly had been
legally opened, and some ordinary business transacted,
the Norwegian ambassador rose, and besought the attention
of king and states while he laid before them the
mission with which he had been intrusted by his royal
master. But before he could explain it, the angry
monarch arose, and sternly commanded him to be silent.
The free-born nobles of Sweden were not thus to lose
their privilege of consulting on the affairs of the monarchy.
Rognevald arose, and dwelt at large on the
present state of their relations with Norway. So long
as the frontier was disputed, West Gothland would be
exposed to depredations; so long as the two kingdoms
were thus hostile, there could be no prosperity for
Sweden. Olaf the Fat was desirous of peace; he had
sent ambassadors for that purpose; and, in proof of his
sincerity, besought the hand of the princess Ingigerda.
At the close of his speech, the monarch arose, and
sharply upbraided Rognevald for his advocacy of the
interests of an enemy. “To this,” observed the king,
“he has been instigated by his wife, a Norwegian lady,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and of the same family as Olaf the Fat. Rognevald,
as the friend, perhaps the ally, of Sweden’s enemy, was
a traitor, and ought to suffer the punishment of one,—to
be deprived alike of his dignity and possessions, and
banished the realm.” The irritated monarch then resumed
his seat, but only to hear what would displease
him the more. The venerable Thorgnyr, whose beard
descended to his knees, whose wisdom was celebrated
throughout the north, and whose presence was so majestic
as to inspire every one with reverence, was the
next speaker. The assembly were hushed as he rose;
and such is the ascendancy of wisdom, when associated
with virtue and rank, that every one felt that
<i>his</i> opinion would decide the controversy. They
rose at the same time,—an unconscious tribute of
respect to this Nestor. His speech, illustrative as it
is of the times, and of Swedish freedom, we give entire.
“The kings of the Swedes are not what they once
were. My grandfather could remember Eric the son
of Emund, when in the vigour of manhood. That
king, each summer, undertook some warlike expedition,
adding to his empire Finland, Carelia, Esthonia, Courland,
and other regions,—exploits of which the lofty
mounds visible at this day are triumphant proofs; yet
Eric was not too proud to be advised; nor did he refuse
to hear every one that addressed him. My father was
long the companion and friend of Biorn, whose character
he thoroughly understood, whose reign was uninterruptedly
flourishing,—no part of the kingdom escaping
his salutary care; yet Biorn was indulgent to his
friends, easy of access, and always inclined to good
advice. And I remember Eric the Victorious, whose
companion I was in so many expeditions; he enlarged
the bounds of the kingdom, and nobly defended what
he had thus acquired; yet <i>he</i> was always ready to
follow good counsels. Now we have a king whose
negligence has occasioned the loss of some tributary
regions; yet he would leave to no one the freedom of
speaking any other thing than what he is pleased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>hear; and to check the honest use of the tongue is his
constant aim. More ambitious than his valiant predecessors,
he really aspires to the conquest of all Norway,
and thus disturbs the public tranquillity. King Olaf!
it is the wish of the country that thou shouldst make
peace with Olaf the Fat, and give him thy daughter
Ingigerda. If it be thy wish to recover the possessions
which thine ancestors once held in the east, we are all
ready to accompany thee in the expedition. If, on the
other hand, in regard to Norway, thou art unwilling to
follow the advice we have given thee, know that we will
no longer tolerate thy frequent violations of the public
tranquillity, and of the constitutional laws; with our
swords we will fall upon thee, and give thee to destruction.
Such was the custom of our forefathers, who
were greater than we. In the assembly of Mula, did
they not cast five kings into the deep pit, because those
princes were, as thou art to us, insultingly proud to
their people? Choose, therefore, and instantly choose,
whether thou wilt follow our counsel!” This bold
speech—so characteristic of the Swedish nobles in
their best days—was received with tumultuous applause
by the assembled multitude; sword and shield
rang together, and every man was ready to follow the
bidding of the venerable asserter of his rights. The
humbled monarch rose; his will was that of his people;
his predecessors had always left matters of grave import
to their decision; and the present business should be
left entirely to them. In a moment the tumult was
hushed; the chiefs of the assembly, with the sanction
of the rest, decreed peace with Norway, named the
ambassadors who were to be sent, and declared that
Ingigerda should be the wife of Olaf the Fat. Rognevald
was intrusted with the care of betrothing; and
the princess sent many gifts, as pledges of her affection,
to her intended husband.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1013.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Omnipotent as was the authority of the states over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the king of Sweden, when they were dissolved he was
again supreme. He resolved to evade the performance
of his pledge; and, instead of proceeding with his
daughter to the confines of the two kingdoms, to deliver
her into the arms of Olaf, he forebore even to mention
the journey, nor would he allow others to mention it in
his presence. He was, above all, indignant with the
jarl Rognevald, to whom he attributed his humiliation
at the recent meeting of the states,—for Thorgnyr was
above his vengeance. At length the anxiety of Ingigerda
could not be suppressed; and she resolved, whatever
the cost, to learn from her father when he intended
to commence his journey. One day, as he was returning
from his favourite sport of hawking, and, from
unusual success, was in high spirits, she advanced to
meet him, and congratulated him. “Didst thou ever
know a monarch,” demanded he, “whom so much
good fortune attended in so short a time?” “Truly,”
replied the maiden, “this morning’s sport has been successful;
thou hast taken five birds: but was not Olaf of
Norway the better sportsman, seeing that, in one morning
also, he took five kings, and annexed their possessions
to his own?”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><sup>[241]</sup></a> The father dismounted, then
looking at her, said, “Listen, Ingigerda! Whatever
thy affection for this fat king of Norway, he will never
be mate of thine!”—In vain did Olaf advance to the
frontiers to receive his bride; neither of her nor of her
father could he obtain the least tidings; and, in great
mortification, he returned to Drontheim. Rognevald,
whom Ingigerda acquainted with the disposition of the
Swede, laid her communication before the king of Norway,
whose rage was equal to his disappointment. His
first impulse was to lay waste the Gothlands; but from
this step he was dissuaded by his counsellors, who justly
observed, that this kind of vengeance was unworthy of
a monarch; that he should wait for the assembly of his
states, demand forces equal to the enterprise, and then
march into Sweden to obtain satisfaction for his wrongs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>When he heard that the princess had been promised by
Olaf to Jarislaf, duke of Holmgard, he would assuredly
have instantly marched, had not another consideration
detained him. Olaf had another daughter, Astridda by
name, who was then on a visit to the princely Rognevald.
In his anxiety to preserve harmony between
kings with whom he was so closely connected, the jarl
one day asked a favourite poet and emissary of Olaf
whether his master would be willing to receive the hand
of that princess, in the place of Ingigerda. If he would,
there was the lady, and the marriage might be celebrated
without consulting her father. The poet immediately
repaired to Olaf, praised the beauty, the wit, the
accomplishments of Astridda, who was in no respect
inferior to her sister, and informed him that the princess
would be ready to marry him without the consent of
her father. Olaf accepted the proposal; but his motive
was the vexation he should cause the Swedish king,
rather than attachment to the princess. The poet was
sent for her; and in a short time, accompanied by
Rognevald, she passed into Norway. The sponsal ceremony
was immediately performed; and, in a few days,
it was followed by their nuptials. This proceeding of
Rognevald would have brought ruin on his head, had
not circumstances befriended him. Olaf, anxious that
his daughter Ingigerda should marry Jaroslaf, endeavoured
to obtain her consent. As she had lost all hope
of the Norwegian, now her brother-in-law, and was
offended at the manner in which he had treated her, she
no longer resisted, provided she might select, as her
companion and friend, any Swedish chief she wished to
reside with her at the court of Holmgard. The promise
was given, and she selected Rognevald. Olaf was
indignant, but he could not revoke his pledge; and he
only added that, if the odious jarl did not appear in his
sight, and embarked without his knowledge, he would
not forbid the appointment. Thus Ingigerda sailed to
Gardarik, and became the wife of Jaroslaf. Hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>she had not seen Olaf of Norway; but they were destined
to meet many years after this event.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1018.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The conduct of the Swedish Olaf was resented by the
states in their next assembly. He had not given his
daughter to the Norwegian; he had not made peace
with Norway; and, notwithstanding the recent marriage
of Olaf with the Swedish princess, West Gothland
was in hourly danger of war. In the next diet, the
proceedings were stormy. A powerful body raised to the
throne <i>Jacob Omund</i> or rather <i>Emund</i>, the son of Olaf, a
child scarcely twelve years of age. In great consternation,
the Swedish king proposed to meet his rival, and
to make peace on a double basis. The two kings did
meet; and the Swede, who had been taught a lesson,
was not merely affable, but kind. To set at rest the
dispute between them, in regard to the boundary, they
agreed to leave it to the chance of the dice; and the
Norwegian was the winner in the game. From this
day to the death of Olaf, there was no war between the
two kingdoms. The Swedish Olaf was too anxious to
gratify his subjects to oppose their interests or wishes.
They allowed him to retain the sceptre, but a portion
of his kingdom was placed under the administration of
his son.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>On his part, Olaf of Norway was no less desirous of
peace. The internal state of his kingdom was far from
satisfactory. Many of his subjects, however they might
outwardly conform to Christianity, were still pagans,
and practised their rites in secret. In a tour through
the uplands, in the summer of 1018, he discovered many
whom the severity of his predecessor and his own had
rendered apostates;—many who had been forced to
receive baptism, but who, on the departure of their
tyrant, had insensibly relapsed to their ancient faith.
Great was his wrath at the discovery, and he evinced it
in a manner worthy of the age. Some of the delinquents—those,
probably, who had any substance to fill
his coffers—he banished for ever; the hands and feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of some he mutilated; others he blinded; some he beheaded;
others he suspended from lofty gibbets. In
short, says the historian, “he did not spare one that
refused to serve God.” These enormities were not to be
borne. Even those who had conscientiously embraced
Christianity revolted at them; and, as many had relations
and friends whom no argument could induce to
forsake their hereditary errors, a spirit of discontent, a
smothered cry for vengeance, was soon heard in the
lonely defiles of the mountains. Five upland kings,—for
the royal title had been left to them by Olaf, and,
we may infer, so also had their religion,—Ruric of
Raumarik, Gudred of the Dales, Ring of Hedmark, with
the kings of Hadaland and Ringarik, entered into a
secret conspiracy against his authority and life. <i>They</i>
had not been injured by him; but their friends and
kindred had been his victims: and who could say how
long they should be spared? It was, at length, agreed
to fall upon him in his passage through Hedmark.
Sending spies to watch his motions, they hastened to a
point on the road through which he had to pass, and
named its vicinity as the place where their own followers
should join them. However safe this secret might have
been, so long as it was confined to the kings alone,
when communicated to the inferior chiefs, whose co-operation
was necessary, it could scarcely remain undivulged.
Ketil, one of the chiefs whom Olaf had
befriended, proceeded to meet the king, and acquaint
him with the danger before him. At a solitary house
near the lake Miors, in the higher regions of Raumarik,
Olaf was acquainted with the meditated deed. With
about 400 men, he instantly departed for the villa where
the five kings were, and arrived there long before their
followers. Approaching it at midnight, he caused it to
be surrounded by his little band, so as to prevent ingress
or egress; and, at the early dawn, all were in his power.
Ruric, the soul of the conspiracy, was doomed to the
loss of both eyes; Gudred, to the loss of his tongue;
the remaining three were exiled, on their promise never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to revisit Norway. The inferior actors did not escape
punishment; some being mutilated, others exiled; but
the majority, who had only acted in obedience to their
chiefs, were pardoned. The domains which all had held
since the days of Olaf Trygveson, were next invaded,
and annexed to the crown. If this was a cruel, it was
a politic step; it rendered Olaf not merely the nominal,
but the only, king of Norway.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1019.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Of the two kings who were thus retained in the
country, Olaf feared Ruric only, whom he always took
with him. Ruric had his servants, his regal apparel,
and his high seat at the table. He was noted for
his revengeful disposition, and for his taciturnity. His
domestics were so ill-treated that they refused to remain
with him, until Sweyn, one of his own kindred, and
formerly his vassal, was placed near him. It was now
his constant object to prevail on Sweyn to join him in
the murder of Olaf, and the man at length consented.
One evening, as the king was going to vespers, Sweyn
took his station at the gate, with a sword concealed
beneath his cloak. But he had not courage to strike;
and his agitation was such as to attract the notice of
his intended victim. “Why that troubled countenance,
Sweyn? Hast thou a design on my life?” Throwing
away his sword, and letting his cloak fall behind
him, the domestic knelt, and could only say, “To God
and thee, O king, I resign myself!” He was immediately
fettered; but was soon released and exiled. The
only punishment inflicted on Ruric was, that his chair
was taken from the royal table, and placed in another
apartment; that his bed was removed to a less honourable
place, and two domestics ordered to attend him night
and day. After this event, he grew moody and capricious:
sometimes he talked with amazing volubility,
and, what was more important (for his talents were
great), with wit or judgment, as the humour predominated;
at other times a sullen taciturnity for days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>together, rendered him as disagreeable as he had before
been captivating. When in these moody fits, he was
evidently devising the means of revenge, or at least of
escape. One night, when Ruric had retired to rest,
somewhat intoxicated, a man called the Little Finn,
who had been his domestic in his prosperous days,
entered the apartment, with a large vessel of mead. This
he presented to all the domestics who slept in the same
apartment as his master, and it was so potent that it immediately
sent them to sleep,—the more easily as they
were previously half drunk. In a short time, Ruric
awoke his two guards, under the pretext that he wanted
to go outside the house. Rubbing their eyes, and
gaping, they accompanied him, but were immediately
slain by twelve men whom the Little Finn had brought
to the spot, and who hurried the king on board a
vessel which lay near the shore. One of the royal
party, having occasion to visit the court-yard, found the
two corpses yet bleeding and warm. In great alarm, he
awoke Thord, the bearer of the royal banner, and acquainted
him with the tragedy which had just been
perpetrated. Both wished to awake the king; but who
durst presume to do so? It was at length agreed to
ring the bells of the neighbouring chapel; and Olaf,
thinking that the time of matins was come, suddenly
rose, and was made acquainted with the disappearance
of Ruric, and the murder of the two guards. The
household was soon in motion, and the fugitives pursued.
Accompanied by thirty men, one of Olaf’s captains
leaped into a vessel, and stood out to sea. Dawn
soon appeared, and the vessel which carried Ruric, and
which was manned by an equal number of men, was
descried. The pursuit was vigorously maintained; when
an arrow from the bow of the Little Finn, the best
marksman of his age, found its way to the leader’s heart.
Still the pursuit was continued; until the companions of
Ruric, apprehensive of being taken, drew close to the
shore, and plunged into the neighbouring woods, leaving
him to his fate. The blind chief was conveyed back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>to Tunsberg, and consigned to closer custody than before.
But even now he indulged in the dream of
revenge, and fortune seemed to furnish him with an
opportunity of realising it. Easter was at hand, and
Olaf, with his whole household, attended divine service
in the church. His seat was in a kind of crypt at the
north end of the choir. Here, such was his thoughtlessness,
he was accompanied by Ruric, for whose conversion
he was singularly anxious, and to whose crimes
he was unusually indulgent. On the conclusion of the
service, when the congregation were departing, Ruric
drew a concealed dagger, and aimed it at the king. The
blow entered his garments, but did not touch his skin.
Leaping from his seat, a second blow was aimed at him,
but without effect; and in another moment, the ferocious
chief was taken and fettered, and led out of the church.
Olaf was exhorted to put the rebel to death; but he
refused, and substituted banishment into the dreary
wastes of Iceland. There, in a few years, Ruric paid
the debt of nature.—Strange that Olaf should pardon
the murderer, yet execute the pagan! That he should
deem the most horrible of crimes less heinous than
conscientious, however mistaken, belief! But such
has always been the policy of the Roman Catholic
church.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The uplands were not the only parts of Norway in
which idolatry was to be found. While at Nidaros one
winter, he learned that in Halogaland, Naumdal, and
the interior of Drontheim, even the outward forms of
Christianity were disregarded. To judge for himself
in so important a matter, Olaf, when spring arrived,
proceeded into Naumdal, where he held assemblies of
the people. He soon found that there were delinquents
enough, and he resolved not to spare them. He afflicted
them, says the historian, with grievous penalties, not
sparing the powerful any more than the humble; and
he made all the inhabitants promise that in future they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>would preserve the holy faith incorrupt. By passing
through the most sequestered districts, he discovered
what would otherwise have escaped him. On his return
to Nidaros, he learned that in the interior of the province,
at the yule festival, the horns and cups were, as of yore,
consecrated to the gods; that oxen were still sacrificed,
and the altars sprinkled with their blood. In great
anger, yet eager to examine into the truth of the charge,
Olaf sent for many of the farmers, to interrogate them
on the subject. But they asserted that their convivial
meetings had nothing to do with religion; that, like
their fathers, they indulged over their cups, but were
not so foolish as to be the slaves of heathenism. Though
he was forced to dismiss them, he was not satisfied;
and about the middle of winter he sent for them a
second time, laying before them the information which
he had subsequently received. Again was the charge
denied; and they were again dismissed, but not without
the assurance that Olaf would soon judge for himself.
After the Easter festivities, he accordingly repaired into
that district; and sending for Thorold, one of his vassals,
questioned him closely as to the existence of idolatry in
his neighbourhood. At first the man was unwilling to
speak; he dreaded the vengeance of the Pagans; but
being assured of the royal protection, he said that most
of the people had not yet been baptized; that those
who had, had certainly reverted to the worship of Thor
and the other deities; that there were scarcely any
Christians in heart; that sacrifices were still offered, at
the ancient seasons; and that at their meetings, which
they asserted were purely convivial, twelve men officiated
as priests. Hearing these charges, for the truth of
which he had no guarantee,—nothing beyond the
bare word of Thorold,—Olaf summoned his vassals,
hastened to the place of entertainment, put the leaders to
death, imprisoned others, and plundered all. But the
most arbitrary and most unjust part of his conduct was
that which authorised his followers to visit the houses
of the suspected, and kill or bind or plunder them at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>pleasure. That the innocent, if they had any substance,
or any enemies, suffered with the guilty, is undoubted.
Of both, many escaped before their persecutors arrived.
Of the prisoners, some were put to death, some mutilated,
others fined, and many banished.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1021.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Having left many priests, and caused many churches
to be erected, in Naumdal, Olaf proceeded into the
uplands, for the purpose of rooting out the remains of
paganism. Here, too, he found many who had not
been baptized,—and many who, if they had been,
were more than suspected of being addicted to the
ancient religion. From the more considerable persons
he demanded hostages, as pledges of their fidelity in
future; the rest were more summarily dealt with. But
the force he had with him was inadequate to the chastisement
of all the delinquents,—for whole districts
had neglected the new religion. He therefore sent out
the arrow, and being joined by his vassals, issued an
edict that those who refused to embrace Christianity
with all their hearts must either fight him or see their
lands devastated and themselves punished. As before,
hypocrites enough hastened to him to profess obedience
to his command, while the more conscientious, or the
more indigent, fled into other districts. Hearing of
these transactions, Godbrand of the Dales, a powerful
man and a pagan, having sent forth the arrow, addressed
his warriors at some length:—“There has arrived on
the margin of the Loar a man called Olaf, commanding
us to follow a religion different from that which we
have hitherto followed, breaking all the images of our
gods, and asserting that his God is greater and more
powerful than they. To me it seems marvellous that
the earth does not swallow him,—that our gods suffer
him to live. Of this I am quite sure,—that, if we
take the statue of Thor from the temple near us, and
bear him towards the enemy, he will destroy their God,
Olaf himself, and all his companions.” These words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>will show that there were parts of Norway which paid
only a nominal obedience to the monarchs of Drontheim,
which had preserved their stormy independence
from a remote age to the eleventh century. These
were the mountainous parts, especially the dales, which
were scarcely accessible to an army, where defence was
more easy, where a great number of invaders could
not find subsistence. The speech of Godbrand was
received by the hearers with acclamation. All cried that
they would not forsake their gods; that if Olaf came
into their peaceful valleys, he should not leave them
alive. Seven hundred men were immediately placed
under the command of Godbrand’s son, and with them
he proceeded to the entrance of the Dales. His example
was followed by other rustics; so that the opposition
which awaited Olaf in these defiles threatened to
be more formidable than any which he had yet encountered.
On reaching the ground where they were
encamped, he caused a trumpet to be sounded, and a
herald to bear his command that they would instantly
receive Christianity. They rejected it with contempt;
but they were soon defeated and compelled to flee.
Some were taken prisoners, among whom was the son
of Godbrand. Olaf could sometimes act with policy as
well as humanity; and on this occasion he dismissed
the humbled chief, bidding him tell the father that the
victor would soon be in the centre of the dales. Touched
with this generosity, the young man besought his father
not to contend with Olaf. How, indeed, could he, with
only 200 men remaining? By the old pagan he was
sharply reproved for this pusillanimity, and told that,
for his sins, he had been accompanied by some evil
genius. The question of peace or war was again proposed
to the Thing, or assembly of the people; and
they resolved that twelve men should be sent to Olaf,
to obtain the most favourable conditions that could be
granted, and to invite him to meet them. The two
parties did meet in those solitary wilds; and Olaf, amidst
a heavy shower of rain, which continued the whole day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>proceeded to explain the leading doctrines of Christianity.
His explanation, however, was not very clear
to the assembled pagans. “We know nothing of the
God thou preachest,” said Godbrand, “and how can we,
since neither thou nor anybody else has ever seen him?
But we have a god whom we can all see whenever we
please. To-day he does not appear on account of the
rain; but if he should come to this meeting, you could
not withstand his looks: he would frighten you all,—for
he is a terrible god.” The old man concluded by
saying that, if the Christian God should work a palpable
miracle, he would then believe in his power. After the
assembly had been dismissed, and Olaf, with the son of
Godbrand, had retired to his temporary abode, the
former had the curiosity to ask what was the construction
of the image to which Godbrand had alluded.
He was informed that it was a vast statue of Thor, with
crown and mallet and costly ornaments, and hollow
within. Every day, four loaves of bread, and a corresponding
portion of flesh, was presented to this idol.
That night, says the historian, the king could not sleep,
such was his anxiety to convince the people of God’s
power and of Christ’s divinity. The truth is that he
was more anxious for his own safety; for the countrymen
were resorting, in greater numbers than before, to
the scene of action. To be secure in case of attack, he
despatched one of his chiefs for a reinforcement. The
following day, Thor was wheeled to the place where
the assembly deliberated. As it approached, the
people rose and saluted it. It was placed in the
midst of the place,—having the pagans on one side and
the Christians on the other. Godbrand, rising, said,—“Here,
king, is our god; but where is thine? He is,
I suppose, in some obscure corner, with downcast looks.
Thou art not so confident as thou wast; no more is that
horned<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><sup>[247]</sup></a> man who sits beside thee, and is called your
bishop. This our god, who rules all things, looks upon
you with angry eyes; you are evidently afraid; you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>dare not lift up your eyes. Wherefore, lay aside your
vain superstition, and believe in the present god, who
has your fate in his hands.” Telling one of his attendants
to have a huge club in readiness, Olaf arose,
and replied to the speech of Godbrand. “Their god
was blind and dumb, who could do nothing for himself
or others; he could not even move from his place
without being carried.” “Our God,” added he, “is in
the east,” alluding to the sun as the brightest emblem
of the Deity. Hearing this, the people unconsciously
turned their looks in that direction. This was the
signal for the chief who held the mace. One ponderous
blow broke the deity to pieces; and from the
fragments, as they fell, crept serpents, rats, and spiders,
in great numbers. Seeing this, most of the people fled;
but they were soon recalled by the king, who wished to
converse amicably with them. Having ridiculed their
prostrate deity, he left them the usual option,—of
fighting him or embracing Christianity. Godbrand
was the first to set the example. As his god could not
help or revenge itself, it had manifestly no power, and
he would now believe in the Christians’ God. He was
followed by the rest; and, in a short time, a church
arose in each valley. From this place Olaf repaired
into Hedmark, Raumarik, and Hadaland, where such
districts as were not already Christians were speedily
made so, in the Roman Catholic sense of the word,—that
is, the people were <i>baptized</i>. Of <i>instruction</i> nobody
thought; or, if they did, it was left to time. But
if Olaf had been as enlightened as he was ignorant, he
could not, with the few priests at his disposal, have
effected much good. Until England and Germany sent
more ecclesiastics, and some provision was made for their
education in Norway itself, little good was or could be
effected.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1022
to
1023.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Olaf found that the old religion maintained
its sway among the inhabitants generally, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>always recourse to the same policy: he collected troops,
marched to the place, sent forth his staff, which was
the signal for the people to meet in the public Thing,
just as the arrow was the signal of war; and proposed
the alternative of a battle or conversion. But it sometimes
happened that the arrow had been sent out before
his arrival, and that the people were assembled in numbers
too great for him to attack with safety. Thus, in the
diet of Valders, when the proceedings were opened, and
the king began to talk of conversion, he was immediately
enjoined silence; nor would this have been the worst result,
had he not been cunning enough to call upon the
legal disputants to lay their cases before him for adjudication.
In a moment the tumult was hushed; each party
who was or fancied himself aggrieved began to complain,
and the king was occupied the whole of the day in
giving his decisions. The following days he laid waste
their territory with fire and sword—fine occupation
for their monarch! To protect their property the men
assembled in arms; but as Olaf transferred his hostilities
from place to place, no large body could be
collected together; or, if it were, it soon dissolved itself.
Hence he was able to assail them in succession, and
force them to submission. The use which he made of
his victory was the same as on other occasions; he
baptized, hung, maimed, banished, fined, and returned
to his capital in the belief that he had done Heaven
much service.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1026
to
1027.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But from these conversions—these persecutions—Olaf
was at length diverted by the report that Canute
the Great, king of England and Denmark, was preparing
to assert his rights to Norway. Why so ambitious
a monarch as the Dane had so long delayed the
vindication of his claim is not easily explained: England
had been long tranquil, and from Denmark no
commotion was to be dreaded. Whatever the motives
of his inactivity, he never forgot that Norway had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>subdued by his father. In 1025 he asserted his claim
through his ambassadors, who saw king Olaf at Tunsberg.
Norway, he said, was his by the right of conquest,
and that right he should not renounce; but, as
he was averse to the shedding of blood, he would
acknowledge Olaf as king if the latter would do him
homage, and pay him the same tribute as the jarls had
paid. The reply of Olaf was, that he would pay no
tribute, but defend Norway to the last extremity.
Knowing that the cloud of invasion must burst upon
him, he selected and obtained the alliance of Sweden.
Olaf was no more; but Omund (or Emund) was not
inattentive to the connection which bound the royal
families of the two kingdoms. To arrange the means
of defence the two kings met in Gothland, and lost no
time in preparing their vessels for service. As Canute
delayed the threatened expedition much longer than
was expected, they were unwilling to keep their armaments
idle, and they assumed the aggressive,—Olaf
choosing the Danish islands, especially Zealand, as the
scene of his depredations; Omund preferring the
nearer province of Scania. In a short time, however,
they joined their fleets, and continued their ravages.
The summer being past and no enemy appearing,
Omund returned to Sweden,—leaving, however, a portion
of his fleet under the orders of Olaf. When
Canute heard of these ravages, he hastened his preparations.
Another subject, too, made him anxious to
revisit Denmark. The Danes were dissatisfied with
the absence of their monarch. From the foundation
of the state, never had they been without a present
chief—often with many—to defend their coasts against
the piratical kings of the north. Now that Olaf and
Omund were assailing them with impunity, their complaints
became the louder. To appease them, Ulf, the
brother-in-law of Canute, and the most powerful of the
Danish nobles, had recourse to a bold imposture; he
produced forged letters, which he alleged came from
Canute, commanding the states to recognise his son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Harda Canute as king of Denmark. The motive which
led him to this step is obvious. The prince was only
ten years of age, and the regency must necessarily rest
with him. How he expected to escape the vengeance
of his monarch is surprising: probably he looked for
impunity to the unanimous voice of Denmark, and to
the interference of Emma, the queen, who had sanctioned
the plot, and transmitted her husband’s signet to
him. Seeing the royal seal, the people immediately proclaimed
the young prince. Both Ulf and Harda
Canute soon repented of the step. Two kings were
ravaging their coasts: Canute only could defend them;
and his arrival might soon be expected. To avert his
anger, they supplicated the queen to employ her influence
in their behalf; and, after some entreaty, the
monarch agreed that if Harda Canute and the jarl
would apply to him for pardon, and lay the usurped
crown at his feet, he would exact no vengeance for the
past. Accordingly, both proceeded to England, knelt
before him, and humbly entreated his forgiveness. The
royal child was heartily, Ulf reluctantly pardoned,—if
that can be called pardon, when a secret determination
is made to destroy the object whenever a new
occasion shall be presented. To extinguish the last
spark of this rebellion, no less than to chastise the presumption
of the two northern kings, he sailed for the
north.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1027.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Canute arrived in the Baltic, he found that
Scania was ravaged by the combined fleets of Norway
and Sweden. In a naval battle off that coast he had a
hard struggle, but, in the end, had so far the advantage
that he compelled the enemy to retire. After this partial
success, he did not forget Ulf the jarl. Inviting
that noble to a feast at Roskilda, the latter endeavoured,
by mirthful conversation, to dissipate the gloom which
hung on the countenance of the monarch. The chessboard
was introduced, and, in the game which followed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the anger of Canute was still further increased. The
jarl took one of the king’s knights; but the king took it
back again, and, in a hasty tone, bid Ulf not play in
that manner. One of this chief’s worst characteristics
was an irritable temper, which he could not always
control, even in the presence of his lord. He not only
struck the table with much anger, but rose to leave the
apartment. “Coward! dost thou flee?” cried the insulted
king. “Thou wouldst have fled farther,” replied
the jarl, “but for me. Was I a coward in the
late action at the mouth of the Helge, when I bore aid
to thee, whom the Swedes were beating like a dog?”
These rash words sealed his fate. Though he took
refuge in the cathedral, the next morning the monarch
ordered him to be slain; and the deed was perpetrated
in the choir. For this action, the royal assassin had
thenceforth no peace; remorse was his daily companion:
to allay it he became a benefactor to the church, and
undertook a pilgrimage to Rome.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c017'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1027
to
1028.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Winter approaching, Omund of Sweden returned
home with his armament. For some time longer, Olaf
remained to watch the motions of the Danes; but he had
some reason to know that a spirit of discontent prevailed
among his followers. When summoned to the council
their opinions were divided, in cases where unanimity
was most required. It was evident that some of them
were bought by Canute’s gold, or by the hope of his
favour. Many, too, of the Norwegians even—the bravest
of that nation—were in the armament of the Dane. As
so little dependence was, after Omund’s departure, to
be placed in his fleet, Olaf sent it to the Swedish ports,
and returned, by way of West Gothland, into Vikia.
At Sarfsburg he determined to pass the winter; and he
endeavoured, by presents, to secure the attachment of
his chief nobles; but he found that his own partisans
were fewer, and those of his enemy more numerous, than
he had anticipated. In some districts he could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>venture without a strong armed force. As he dared not
venture into the north, and was unsafe in the uplands,
he proceeded to Tunsberg; from thence he despatched
messengers into all the provinces, to hasten the levy of
ships and men. Those in his immediate neighbourhood
obeyed his mandate, rather through fear than love; by
the more distant provinces it was derided. That the
hearts of the people were not with him was manifest;
the great preparations of Canute, which resounded
throughout the kingdom, were either beheld with indifference,
or openly desired. To what causes must this
almost universal defection be ascribed? Undoubtedly
to many. By the admirers of this king—that is, by the
Roman Catholics—it has been contended, that the chief
was the attachment of the Norwegians to their ancient
idolatry. That this was a great cause cannot be disputed;
but we may hesitate before we admit it as the
principal. Olaf Trygveson was no less zealous than he; yet
that monarch was in no danger from a foreign invader,
and, to the very last, was supported by a loyal people.
The truth is, Olaf the Saint had turned his friends into
enemies, by the capriciousness of his conduct. If his
predecessor was a furious bigot, he was, at least, beloved
by his immediate attendants, and feared by his people.
To his domestics the saint was often austere, not very
liberal, and frequently tyrannical. In proof of this, we
may adduce the confession of his greatest favourites,
that, whatever the urgency of the occasion, they dared
not awake him when asleep.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c017'><sup>[252]</sup></a> The man who thus inspired
fear, even in his own palace, could not be loved.
Then he was rigid, imprudently rigid, in the administration
of justice. It was, indeed, better to err on this
side than on that of laxity; still he should have made
some allowance for times and circumstances, and have
been satisfied with pecuniary mulcts where he exacted
mutilation or death. Add, that he had not the commanding
talents of the son of Trygve; that he was frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>fickle alike in his attachments and designs;
that he was oppressive in his exactions; that he violated
the pledges which he had given to respect the privileges
of the native chiefs; and we have the key to the universal
disaffection of which he was soon to become the
victim.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c017'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1028
to
1029.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In the spring of 1028, Canute, with a powerful
armament, sailed for Norway. Disembarking on the
coast of Agder, he commanded the people to assemble
in a provincial Thing,—a command which was promptly
obeyed. Here he was acknowledged king of Norway,
and no voice was raised against his election. On his
way to Nidaros,—the modern Drontheim,—wherever
he landed the people flocked in multitudes to receive
him, and to pay him homage. On reaching that city,
where Olaf had so much resided, and where he was so
much detested, Canute was joyfully acknowledged the
sole monarch of the country. During all this time,
Olaf remained at Tunsberg, in the vain expectation of
succour from some portion of his subjects. At length
he sailed round the southern coast, rather as a spy than
a monarch; and he had the satisfaction of vanquishing
one of his rebellious jarls: but this was no advantage,
for it exasperated the kindred of the fallen chief, who
forced him precipitately to retire. Proceeding northward,
he found that his own subjects (Canute had returned
to Denmark in the full confidence that the new
conquest was secure) were on the deep to intercept him.
As their force was so much superior to his, he hastily
disembarked, in the resolution to pass overland into
Sweden. But the project was not without danger;
every moment the countrymen might rise and deliver
him into the hands of his enemies. To escape this evil
he traversed the most solitary paths, with a celerity to
which his fear gave additional wings. Continuing his
way into the dales and Hedmark, he had some reason
to fear for his life. Though he had many kinsmen in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the uplands, the majority of the people were his enemies,
and were ready to seize him. As yet, however, he had
a considerable guard,—about 300 men,—and open
force, in a rural, secluded district, might be resisted.
But when he perceived that his followers were daily
diminishing, he had no alternative but to flee into
Sweden. Hako the jarl, Canute’s lieutenant for the
whole of Norway, would soon pursue him; and expedition
was therefore doubly necessary. Accompanied
by his queen, Astridda, and a few companions whose
fidelity no misfortunes could shake, he passed into
Vermeland, and was thus free from the apprehension
of pursuit. His expedition saved him; for had he
remained any longer in Norway he must have fallen
into the hands of the jarl Hako, who was pursuing him
with a force which he could not have resisted. There
he passed the winter. When summer arrived, leaving
his queen and his daughter in Sweden, he proceeded
to Holmgard in Gardarik, to solicit the aid of the
king, or rather of Ingigerda the queen.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c017'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1029.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>By the king and queen of Holmgard the regal fugitive
was received with much hospitality. Seeing the distraction
of Norway, they endeavoured, by the offer of a
considerable province, to prevail on him to remain in
the country. This would have been his wisest policy;
but his heart yearned to the country of his birth, and
he indulged the hope of being recalled by his subjects.
His was not a strong mind; but in devotion—or
we should rather say in the external offices of his
church—he sought for consolation. But ambition
was his prevailing quality. Night and day he meditated
the means of returning; and, with a mind so
impressed, we cannot be surprised that his dreams
assumed the colour of his waking thoughts. A royal
shade accosted him, exhorted him to return, and promised
him success. Had Olaf been an enlightened
man, or known much of that religion which he so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>zealously professed, he would have understood that a
vision recommending all the horrors of civil war could
not be from heaven. In about a year he left Gardarik,
and sailed to Sweden. Here he learned that Hako the
jarl was dead, and no successor yet nominated by
Canute. This he thought a favourable opportunity for
the vindication of his rights, and he proceeded to the
Swedish court to solicit aid. By Emund he was nobly
received; but the information which reached him from
Norway did not induce him to hasten his departure.
When the local governors heard of his arrival in Sweden,
they sent forth the arrow of war, in the determination
of resisting his entrance. The spies whom he sent into
the country were unanimous in their report that the
popular mind was indisposed to him,—that he should
abandon the intention of returning. These representations,
however, were counterbalanced by his hopes:
in a few months after his arrival in Sweden, he
procured 400 men from Emund, with permission to
raise as many more as chose to join him, and proceeded
through the centre of Sweden towards Norway.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1030.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>On the confines of that kingdom, being joined by his
kindred and their vassals, he found that his whole force
amounted to 1200 men. With this force, had there
existed any attachment to his cause, he might have
triumphed; but as he proceeded through the northern
districts of Drontheim, nobody joined him. In some
places, indeed, he forced the inhabitants to assemble,
and compelled those who were still pagan to receive
baptism. Thus the time which he should have turned
to his advantage he lost by his injudicious zeal, and
thereby afforded his enemies leisure to organise the
means of resistance. In another respect he was less
imprudent. Seeing the refusal of the countrymen to
join him, he was exhorted by his followers, of whom
many were Swedish banditti, to burn their houses, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>lay waste their fields, to cut them down wherever they
could be found. He had the humanity to refuse his
sanction to this atrocious proposal. He had, he said,
one regal prerogative left,—the power of forgiving.
On entering the district of Sticklestadt, he perceived a
large force drawn up to oppose him. Arranging his
own followers in order of battle, he exhorted them to
fight manfully for their religion, their king, their
families. On the other, Sigurd, the bishop, who was in
the army of Canute, no less strongly exhorted his party
to drive this invader from the kingdom. The character
which the prelate drew of that monarch was not an
enviable one. From his youth he had been remarkable
for his robberies and executions; he had exiled or put
to death the noblest of his chiefs; he had acted with
singular treachery towards the upland kings,—whose
privileges, contrary to his solemn pledges, he had violated,
and whose persons he had afterwards mutilated;
to all men, high or low, he had been tyrannical; he
had lost all his friends; and he was now followed only
by the enemies of Norway, or by professed bandits.
This description was not overcharged, and it may be
admitted as a fair estimate of his character. The battle
now engaged, and Olaf fought with much courage; but
in the end he fell, and most of his kinsmen with him.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c017'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That the moral portrait of Olaf may be finished, and
his claims to sanctity appreciated, we have yet to add
that he had a concubine, and by her a bastard,—Magnus
the Good,—four years after his marriage with
Astridda. The circumstances connected with the birth
of this prince are worthy of relation. Alfhilda, the
royal concubine, was observed to be pregnant; and
everybody knew that this was the result of her intercourse
with Olaf. One night she was seized by the
pains of labour, which were unusually severe; both her
life and that of her infant were despaired of before it
was brought into the world. Even after that event,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>so precarious was its existence, that the priest who was
present insisted on its immediate baptism, and desired
Sigvat the poet to awake the king for the purpose of
knowing what name was to be given it. Nothing
can better illustrate the tyranny of Olaf than the fact
that Sigvat, favourite as he had long been, durst not
fulfil this commission, at a time when mother and child
were apparently on the brink of the grave. “Who
dares awake him?” replied Sigvat. “But the infant
must be baptized,” rejoined the priest. “I would
rather incur the responsibility of naming the child,”
said the poet, “than of awaking the king.” The name
was Magnus. The next morning Olaf was in a great
rage with Sigvat, whom he summoned before him, and
asked how he could have the presumption to impose a
name on his royal son. “Was it not better,” replied
the poet, “to give the child to God rather than to the
devil? Had he died without baptism, he must have
been the devil’s. For my boldness I can but lose my
head; and, if I do so, I must trust to God’s mercy!”
“But why didst thou call the child Magnus?” demanded
Olaf: “I have no kindred of that name.” “Because
it was the name of Charlemagne.” “Thou art a fortunate
man,” said the king. “Nor is this strange, as
fortune is the companion of wisdom. Yet it <i>is</i> strange
when the imprudent man turns his very rashness into
the source of advantage.” In the sequel this Magnus
became king of Norway.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c017'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>As nobody can be admitted into the calendar of saints
without the operation of miracles, which the church
requires as evidence of sanctity, we may be prepared for
those of Olaf. That he healed incurable diseases,
restored sight to the blind, assisted the warriors who
invoked his aid, is asserted by the gravest Icelandic
writers. One which we give in the Appendix, and which
is by far the most imaginative of the number<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c017'><sup>[258]</sup></a> may enable
the reader to judge of what materials they consist. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>sanctity of Olaf rests on a foundation of equal solidity
with his miracles. Yet all the Roman Catholics in Europe
are taught, from their infancy, to believe in both. How
far his character, as given in the text, agrees with that
which Alban Butler has drawn from that immense heap
of rubbish, the Acta Sanctorum, may also be seen in the
Appendix.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c017'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>That</span> the expeditions of the Northmen were not confined
to the shores of the Baltic, long before the period
which is usually assigned to them, is evident from the
whole course of the later Roman history. During the
domination of the empire in Gaul and Britain, the local
governors, whatever their zeal, were unable to prevent
the depredations which the maritime inhabitants of
Friesland and Jutland made on the more southern
coasts. The Saxons and Franks were among the earliest
pirates of the north. In the third century we find
them on the coast of Gaul; in the fourth and fifth,
they were no less troublesome on that of Britain. Even
from the time of Cæsar, the tribes on the maritime
coast, from the mouths of the Rhine to the Baltic Sea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>were beginning to learn the piratical life. Their position
was highly favourable to such pursuits. Located
in the vicinity of rivers, friths, and bays, where the soil
is unproductive, their wants must have led them to
regions where Nature was more lavish of her gifts. This
was more especially the case of the people on the sandy
shores of Friesland and the Baltic; and, in those regions,
they become pirates, just as the Arabs become
robbers,—from necessity. But other causes were also
at work, and probably at a period still earlier. Amidst
the endless migrations of the barbarous tribes who occupied
central and northern Europe, the impulse must
have been extended to more distant shores. When, for
instance, Asiatic Scythia sent forth her swarms to
conquer and to colonise, the original inhabitants either
bent their necks to the new yoke, or escaped from it by
retiring farther to the west. Those of Scandinavia were
compelled to look for settlements in the south; and this
object could only be obtained by means of ships. There
is reason to believe that these emigrations, or maritime
expeditions, came to our own islands before the birth
of Christ; this, indeed, is expressly affirmed by Bede,
who mentions the first arrival of the Picts in these
islands. They came, he informs us, from Scythia; and,
sailing round the southern coast of Britain, landed on
that of Ireland, where the Scots were then settled. As
there was not room for both people, the new comers, in
conformity with the advice of the Scots, proceeded to
the opposite shores, viz., those of Galloway and Argyle.
This could not have been a solitary immigration into
these islands; the Scots themselves were a conquering
and a new tribe when the Picts arrived. If this is true
of the western, it is still more so of the eastern, coasts
of England and Scotland, especially of the latter.
Danish expeditions, before our Saviour’s birth, are frequently
mentioned by Saxo; and, absurd as his chronology
often is, we think that there is some foundation
for his statement, corroborated as it is by that of Bede.
But we must not lose sight of the fact, that the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>writers are speaking of events in themselves dissimilar.
Bede alludes to the emigration of whole tribes, Saxo to
piratical expeditions.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c017'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That at a barbarous period, when agriculture was
little understood, and in barren countries, where the
greatest industry was unavailing, there must have been
many seasons of famine, would be admitted, if it were
not supported by the positive testimony of history.
When they arrived, the younger and more vigorous
class of the people naturally betook themselves to more
southern regions. He that once visited those regions,
would be in no hurry to return. The long duration of
winter, the uncertainty of an early spring, the coldness
and humidity of the atmosphere, which often prevented
the fruits of the earth from arriving at maturity, must
have appeared to striking disadvantage when contrasted
with the greater regularity of seasons in the south. Nor
was this the worst. The north was covered with endless
forests, or with extensive fens, or with bleak mountains,
where industry might labour in vain; in the
south, nature produced, with small labour, what was
necessary for the support of man. Since, in the former,
wars between one tribe and another were of so frequent
occurrence, the condition of the people must have been
dreadful; they must have been often thinned by famine.
Hence the expatriations, whether voluntary or compulsory,
of which we read so much in the ancient history of
the north. One of the earliest on record is that which
took place under Snio, a prince of Jutland. A sore
famine arriving, he published an edict, that, to economise
the grain, none should be used in the brewing
of beer. But this law was ineffectual; the people were
too fond of indulging in the beverage to be thus forced;
and a national Thing was convoked to devise the means
of public safety. That a law was passed for the destruction
of the old, the very young, and those unable
to carry arms, or to cultivate the ground, is affirmed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>several writers; but the statement is incredible. There
is greater truth in another,—that banishment was substituted,
and lots were cast to determine the individuals.
Sweden furnishes us with a second instance, though not
so ancient as the preceding. We have already seen that,
during the pressure of a famine, Olaf Trætelia was
sacrificed to the gods.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c017'><sup>[261]</sup></a> The remedy, however, was
unavailing; the scourge became still greater, and the
people removed into Norway. Two centuries after this
period, one third of the Danes, says Peter Olaf, were
thus driven into exile; and they selected Prussia, Carelia,
Samogitia, and other shores of the Baltic, as their
future abodes. This evil was more ancient than we
usually suppose. We find laws, permitting the exposure
of infants where the parents were unable to
support them, before Christianity was known to the
Franks, or Bavarians, or Swabians, or any other of the
Germanic tribes. Where no temporary law was made
for the expatriation of a certain number of the people,
the more adventurous would often retire of their own
accord. The Scandinavians were no strangers to the
sea; from their childhood they were accustomed to fish
in their bays, gulfs, mouths of rivers, and other parts
of their coasts. This exercise made them familiar with
the management of small vessels, and led them to regard
the watery element as no less friendly than land. As
they became inured to the business, and extended their
voyages, they learned where particular species of fish
were most abundant. It is probable that at a very
early period all the coasts of the Baltic were thus
visited.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c017'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>These circumstances combined will explain the superior
dexterity of the Scandinavians and other Baltic
nations in the management of vessels. If want of
subsistence led them to the deep, whether through
expatriation, or the hope of successful fishing, other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>causes made them pirates. It was easier to take a
vessel well laden with that useful commodity than to
catch it; and when, in these practices, the crew of one
hostile tribe met the crew of another, a battle was sure
to follow. By degrees, vessels for piracy alone were
equipped; nor were the objects of plunder confined to
fish: the houses near the sea-coasts had other articles
of food, other commodities, which would enrich the
pirate’s home. The dangers attending a profession
where the crews were necessarily armed, were not likely
to damp the spirit of adventure. Courage was a part
of the Northman’s religion; death in battle was a good,
since it introduced him at once to the enjoyments of
Odin’s hall,—enjoyments far exceeding whatever this
world could furnish. Piracy, then, was the necessary
result of the Scandinavian’s position; and it must have
been practised more anciently than most historians admit.
Tacitus tells us that in his time the Suiones were
formidable by their fleets. Navigation, indeed, could
not be in its infancy, when such colonies as that of the
Picts undertook voyages so long and hazardous. It
could not be in its infancy during the third century,
when Caransius was nominated by the Roman authorities
of Gaul to protect, at the head of a powerful fleet,
the coasts daily menaced by the barbarians.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c017'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That domestic piracy—viz., piracy confined to their
own coast—distinguished the Scandinavians long before
their expeditions into the south, is undoubted. First, they
had to struggle with the hostile races who had preceded
them in the north,—whom on their arrival they had to
dislodge, and who for so many ages preserved a vindictive
remembrance of the outrage. The Goth and the Finn
must have been enemies from the beginning; and both
must have been equally hostile to the Vends, a Slavonic
tribe of Pomerania, much addicted to piracy. Position,
no less than race, made tribes hereditary enemies. The
Frisons and the Saxons were rivals, and therefore enemies;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>so were the Swedes and the Danes; so were the
Scanians and Norwegians. Their fleets watched the
coasts of each other, ready to fight it whenever the opportunity
was presented. Thus, while the Norwegians
were delighted in making predatory irruptions into
Quenaland, which was inhabited by Finns, the Vends
were harassing the Danes, and the Jutes the Saxons.
In the fifth century—how long before we have not
individual instances to select—the Vends were powerful
enough to infuse terror into the whole of Denmark.
Ismar, their king, ravaged Fionia, defeated king Sivar,
and took prince Jarmeric captive. In the sixth century,
a Slavonian fleet was defeated by Halfdan, king
of Scania. Saxo is full of maritime contests between the
two people; and though his chronology is wrong, the
facts themselves are indisputable. In general, the
Vends exceeded the Scandinavians in ferocity. Both
had great advantages for maritime adventures. Lithuania,
Esthonia, and Livonia were as well provided
with timber as Norway or Sweden; and each country
had a multitude of natural bays and creeks, where
refuge could be sought when the tempest was severe,
or when an enemy appeared too formidable to be resisted.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c017'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But the coasts of the Roman provinces offered the
greatest inducements to piracy. They were Saxons and
Franks whom Caransius had chiefly to oppose. In the
following century, they were more formidable to the
local governors. “In the beginning of the fourth century,”
says Turner, in his valuable history of the Anglo-Saxons,
“the Saxons were not alone on the ocean; other
states, both to the south and north of their own locality,
were moving in concert with them, whose nominal distinctions
were lost in the Saxon name. This addition
of strength multiplied the Saxon fleets, gave new terror
to their hostility, and recruited their losses with perpetual
population. The league extended. Their depredations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>increased their population, affluence, and celebrity;
and these results extended their power. What
emulation, policy, or rapacity may have first prompted,
success and fear made more universal. They who
would not have been tempted to unite, dreaded the
wrath of those whose proffered alliance they refused:
and at length most of the nations north of the Rhine
assumed the name, strengthened the association, and
fought to augment the predominance of the Saxons.
Towards the south, between the Elbe and the Rhine,
the Chauci seem to have led the way. The Frisii,
urged by kindred passion and a convenient position,
willingly followed. The precise date of the accession
of others is not so clear; but in some period of their
power, the Chamavi, and at last the Batavi, the Toxandri,
and Morini, were in their alliance. North of
their territorial position the Cimbri, the Jutes, the
Angles, and others not so discernible, added their numbers
to the formidable league; which lasted until their
expedition to Britain, and then began to dissolve.
Without detaining the reader by a detail of the modern
chorography answering to the position of these tribes,
it may be sufficient to state, concisely, that the progress
and leagues of the Saxon states enlarged gradually from
the Elbe to the Weser; from the Weser they reached
to the Ems; and, still augmenting, they diffused themselves
to the Rhine with varying latitude, as the Franks,
many of whose allies they seduced, quitting that region,
and abandoning their exploits on the ocean, marched
upon Gaul. The extension of this new confederation
was favoured by the change of policy and position
adopted by the Franks. As this people stood foremost
to the Roman vengeance, they experienced its effects.
They had many distressing wars to maintain, which in
time compelled them to abandon maritime expeditions,
and to consolidate their strength for their continental
conflicts. Their ultimate successes made this warfare
the most popular among them. Hence, the nearer we
approach the period of the invasion of England, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>find the Franks less and less united with the Saxons on
the ocean, and even wars begin to be frequent between
the rival friends. As the former moved onward, to the
conquests of Belgium and Gaul, the Saxons appear to
have been the only nation, under whose name the vessels
of piracy were navigated. Saxons were the enemies every
where execrated, though under this title several nations
fought. Some of the tribes on the maritime coast, who
had composed the league of the Franks, abandoned it,
to share the easier warfare and ampler booty of the
Saxons. At last this successful people diffused themselves
into the interior of Germany so victoriously, that
the vast tracts of country embraced by the Elbe, the
Sala, and the Rhine, became subjected to their power,
in addition to their ancient territory from the Elbe to
the Eyder. An old Belgic chronicle, in rhyme, makes
Neder Sassen, Lower Saxony, to have been confined by
the Scheid and the Meuse; but this is a larger extent
than others admit.”<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c017'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In contemplating the piratical expeditions or maritime
conquests of the Northmen, during the pagan age,
greater clearness will be attained by classing them under
the head of each country visited by those people.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. <i>Britain.</i> The Jutes and the Angles were the
most prominent allies of the Saxons. The league was
joined by other people of the north,—by adventurous
Danes no less than Slavonic Pomeranians. At the head
of maritime forces so numerous and so powerful, the
Saxons became dreadful scourges to Gaul and Britain.
“In the latter country, their depredations were rendered
more secure by the frequent irruptions of the Picts and
Scots into the northern counties, who, like them, were
joined in a confederation. Had the Saxons or the
Picts been left to their own efforts, the Roman governors
would not have been so much pressed by the
pirates as they were from the fourth century downwards.
In a similar combination of hostilities, Nectaridus, the
commander of the Saxon shore, was slain, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>general of the island, Fullo-faudes, perished in an ambush.
Several officers were sent by the Roman emperors
to succeed them; but their exertions being
inadequate to the necessity, Theodosius, an experienced
and successful leader, was appointed by Valentinian in
their room. The Picts and the co-operating tribes
attacked from the north, while the Saxons and their
allies assaulted the maritime coasts. Theodosius, from
Richborough, marched towards London, and dividing
his army into battalions, correspondent to the positions
of the enemies, he attacked the robbers encumbered
with their plunder. The bands that were carrying
away the manacled inhabitants and their cattle, he
destroyed, and regained the spoil; of this he distributed
a small share among his wearied soldiers; the residue
he restored to its owners, and entered the city, wondering
at its sudden deliverance, with the glories of an
ovation. Lessoned by experience, and instructed by
the confessions of the captives and deserters, he combated
this mixture of enemies, with well-combined artifice and
unexpected attacks. To recall those who in the confusion,
from fear or from cowardice, had abandoned their
ranks or their allegiance, he proclaimed an amnesty; and
to complete the benefit he had begun, he prosecuted the
war with vigour in the north of Britain. He prevented,
by judicious movements, the meditated attack; and
hence the Orkneys became the scene of his triumphs.
The Saxons, strong in their numbers and intrepidity,
sustained several naval encounters before they yielded
to his genius. They ceased at last to molest the tranquillity
of Britain; and the addition of a deserved
surname, Saxonicus, proclaimed the service of Theodosius.
He added the province of Valentia to Roman
Britain, restored the deserted garrisons, and coerced the
unruly borderers by judicious stations, and a vigilant
defence. The Saxon confederation might be defeated,
but was not subdued. Such was its power, that they
were now bold enough to defy the Roman armies by
land, and invaded the regions on the Rhine with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>formidable force. The imperial general was unable to
repulse them; a reinforcement encouraged him. The
Saxons declined a battle, and sued for an amicable
accommodation. It was granted. A number of the
youth fit for war were given to the Romans to augment
their armies; the rest were to retire unmolested. The
Romans were not ashamed to confess their dread of the
invaders, by a perfidious violation of the treaty. They
attacked the retreating Saxons from an ambush; and,
after a brave resistance, the unguarded barbarians were
slain or made prisoners. It is to the disgrace of literature
that the national historian of the day has presumed,
while he records, to apologise for the ignominious
fraud. Such an action might dishonourably gain a
temporary advantage, but it could only exasperate the
Saxon nation. The loss was soon repaired in the natural
progress of population, and before many years
elapsed, they renewed their depredations, and defeated
Maximus. At the close of the fourth century they
exercised the activity and resources of Stilicho. The
unequal struggle is commemorated by the encomiastical
poet, whose genius gilds, with a departing ray, the
darkening hemisphere of Rome. After his death the
Saxons commenced new irruptions. They supported
the Armorici in their rebellion, awed the Gothic Euric,
began to war with the Franks, and, extending the
theatre of their spoil, made Belgium, Gaul, Italy, and
Germany tremble at their presence.” It must be remembered
that under the word Saxons many tribes
were included,—those of Denmark as well as those
of Holstein.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c017'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>408.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The settlement of the Saxons, the Angles, and the
Jutes—all comprehended within the geographical
limits of Denmark—in Great Britain, has been recorded
in two historical volumes of the Cyclopædia.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c017'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
Thus, in 446, Hengest laid the foundation of the kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of Kent, which, under eighteen successive kings,
subsisted to the close of the eighth century. In 477,
Ella, another Saxon chief, called a smaller one, that
of Sussex, into existence. Of this state the names of
the two first princes only have descended to posterity.
In 519, the more powerful kingdom of Wessex was
founded by Cerdic, and its princes were destined to
unite the other states into one monarchy within three
centuries after its establishment. By Ida, the kingdom
of Bernicia was founded in 547; By Ella, that of
Deira, in 560. These states, being united in 644,
formed the important kingdom of Northumberland,
which subsisted, with some interruptions, until it was
finally annexed, by Athelstane, to the Saxon monarchy.
Mercia, founded, in 586, by Crida; East Anglia, by
Uffa; and Essex, by Eswin; were all ultimately absorbed
in the rising sphere of Wessex. All these royal chiefs
boasted of their descent from Odin; all were of Scandinavian
origin; all spoke the same language, and
followed the same piratical profession. That hordes of
obscure adventurers—mere sea kings—should thus
subdue a great country, has been matter of surprise to
many writers. But we should remember that, at the
period in question, England was not a monarchy,—that,
like the north, it was subject to many kings, and
that the conquest occupied a century and a half.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c017'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>That during this period the Danes, if not the Norwegians,
were brought into relation with the kings of
Scotland, is asserted by Saxo. Frode III., according
to that historian, gave his daughter Ulvilda in marriage
to Thubar king of the Scots. Frode reigned in
the fourth century, not, as Saxo assures us, early in the
first. Whether Hamlet of Jutland, and other Danish
princes, were really in Scotland, cannot be proved;
but there is nothing improbable in the relation. That
country, like England and the north, was divided among
many chiefs, who assumed the regal title; and that
their domains should escape the depredations which so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>afflicted the southern part of the island, is not to be
credited. Beyond all doubt, Scotland was visited by
piratical bands as early, at least, as England. Nor
must we forget that the Saxon kingdom of Bernicia
comprehended, besides the north of England from the
Tees to the Tweed, all the east and centre of Scotland
from the latter river to the Frith of Forth. At what
period the inhabitants north of that Frith were first
molested by the Danes and Norwegians would be a vain
inquiry; we may only infer that it was much earlier
than is generally supposed.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c017'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>As the inhabitants of the Danish islands and of
Norway had no share in the spoils of England, they
were not bound to respect the coasts after their kindred
had established the kingdoms of the polyarchy. Their
ravages, indeed, were experienced by the English chiefs
before Northumbria became a kingdom. Offa of
Mercia, whose domains were invaded by them, had
the valour to defeat, and the generosity to pardon,
his foes. It has, however, been contended that we
find no satisfactory account of the Danes being here
in such numbers as to command the notice of history,
before the eighth century. In this case, the
authority of Saxo is rejected as unworthy of credit.
“Some documents for his history Saxo may have
derived from poems of the ancient Scalds, from inscriptions
on stones and rocks, from an inspection (yet
how imperfect!) of the Icelandic authors, and from the
narrations of his friend. We may even grant to him,
that such men as he enumerates, such actions as he so
eloquently describes, and such poems as he so diffusely
translates, once appeared; but the chronology and succession
into which he arranges them are unquestionably
false. The boasted fountains of the history of the
ancient Scandinavians, their memorial stones and
funeral runæ, the inscribed rings of their shields, the
woven figures of their tapestry, their storied walls, their
lettered seats and beds, their narrative wood, their re-collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>poetry, and their inherited traditions, may
have given to history the names of many warriors, and
have transmitted to posterity the fame of many battles:
but no dates accompanied the memorials; even the
geography of the incidents was very rarely noted.
Hence, however numerous may have been the preserved
memoranda, their arrangement and appropriation were
left to the mercy of literary fancy or of national conceit.
Saxo unfortunately emulated the fame of Livy,
instead of becoming the Pausanias of Scandinavia; and
instead of patiently compiling and recording his materials
in the humble style or form in which he found
them, which would have been an invaluable present to us,
he has shaped them into a most confused, unwarranted,
and fabulous chronology. The whole of his first eight
books, all his history anteceding Ragnar Lodbrog, can
as little claim the attention of the historian, as the British,
history of Jeffry, or the Swedish history of Johannes
Magnus. It is indeed superfluous, if we recollect the
Roman history, to argue against a work which pretends
to give to Denmark a throned existence, a regular government,
and a tissue of orderly and splendid history
for twenty-four royal accessions before the birth of Christ.
Saxo, on whose history many others were formerly built,
refers to the Icelandic writers; but this only increases our
depreciation of his narratives, for they are at irreconcileable
variance with all his history before the ninth century.”<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c017'><sup>[270]</sup></a>
Yet we are far from subscribing, in its most
rigorous sense, to this unfavourable character. Saxo’s
chronology we condemn as much as any writer; but we
do not think that his facts, however distorted by tradition,
are not, for the most part, founded in truth. That the
authority of Snorro is superior to Saxo’s we readily
admit,—superior, we mean, as to chronology; for that the
latter must have been better acquainted with the actions
of the Danes themselves few will be so rash as to deny.
Yet even Snorro assures us that Ivar Vidfadme, a prince
of the seventh century, conquered a fifth part of England.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c017'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>By this expression Northumbria is usually
understood; and there is nothing improbable in the
opinion that the kingdom of Bernicia—that portion of
Northumbria north of the Tweed—was overrun by
this prince.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c017'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>793

<p class='c009'>The alleged depredations of Ragnar Lodbrog in
Northumbria, to which we have slightly alluded in the
first chapter of this volume<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c017'><sup>[273]</sup></a> have in them so much of
the romantic that we can place little dependence on
them. There is but one circumstance that can be made
to lend them even the appearance of probability. About
the period of Ragnar’s death, a formidable body of
Danes descended on the island of Lindisfarne, plundered
the church which contained the shrine of St.
Cuthbert, massacred the ecclesiastics, defiled the altars,
and consumed the building by fire. The lay inhabitants
of the island were not more fortunate; the men were
massacred, the women were forced, the children
tossed on the points of the Danish lances. In the
following year (794) the monasteries of Wearmouth
and Jarrow were visited with the same fate. During
full seventy years,—that is, to the period when the weak
brother of Alfred allowed the centre of England to be
overrun, and when Alfred himself, by his flight, left
the whole kingdom to their mercy,—their depredations
on the eastern coast, from the Frith of Forth to the
Humber, were, however desultory, however interrupted,
most harassing and most destructive. The Saxon kings
of Northumbria, we are told, were too much occupied
in private feuds to have either time or means for defending
the country against the invaders,—if, indeed,
there were any Saxon kings at this time,—if the
Danes were not the actual sovereigns of the province.
It is certain that all the historians of Denmark (who
are confirmed by the Icelandic chronicles) speak of such
a dynasty, and assure us that the sons of Ragnar Lodbrog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>were its kings. We see no reason to dispute this
statement. There is, however, a sad confusion in the
chronology. If Ragnar died in 794, and his sons
avenged him in little more than a year afterwards, they
could not be at the head of the armament which, in
866, appeared off the coast. Probably they and their
successors reigned from the close of the eighth to the
tenth century, and the confederated armament of 866
was one on a larger scale, and headed by other leaders.
What confirms this inference is the fact that at this
time Harald Harfager was subduing the petty kings of
Norway; and that many of them, preferring freedom
to the despotism of a master, left the country with their
bravest warriors. During this period, all the churches
and monasteries of the province were destroyed. In
828, the Danish power in Northumberland must have
been great, or they would not have been powerful,
enough to defeat Egbert, the conqueror of so many
Saxon kingdoms, and the founder of the English
monarchy. After the year 866, when, as we believe,
there were many Norwegians in England, new atrocities
were committed,—atrocities which threw all former
ones into the shade. The monastery of Tynemouth,
which had been restored, was soon in flames; that of
Lindisfarne shared the same fate; yet the monks were
so fortunate as to escape with the relics of St. Cuthbert.
From the smoking ruins of Lindisfarne, Halfdan, one
of the chiefs, hastened to the monastery of Coldingham.
“According to Matthew of Westminster and succeeding
writers, the nuns of Coldingham nobly redeemed the
reputation of their establishment from the stain which
had covered it in the time of St. Cuthbert. The monastery
was now, as in the former case, governed by an
abbess, named Ebba; who, if the historian be credible,
deserves the honours of canonisation somewhat better
than her predecessor. Hearing that it was the custom
of the barbarians first to violate, and then to destroy,
virgins consecrated to God, she assembled the sister-hood
in the chapter house, and exhorted them to save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>their chastity at the expense of their beauty. With a
knife she dreadfully disfigured her countenance; and
her example was followed on the spot by all the nuns.
The Danes soon forced their gates; but turned with
horror from their embraces, and quickly consumed both
them and their nunnery. Though the monk of Westminster
lived so long after the time, he might follow
some better guide than tradition—some record now
lost; nor is the fact itself either improbable or unparalleled.
The same noble conduct is related of the
nuns of Ecija, during the Mohammedan invasion of
Spain. During seven years similar depredations followed
throughout most of Northumbria. Wherever
the Danes penetrated, ecclesiastics were massacred,
churches and monasteries were levelled with the ground;
the whole country, in fact, became a Danish province,
governed by princes of the royal house of that kingdom.
Great as was the evil produced by these merciless
pagans; though the monks, as an order, were almost
wholly annihilated, and civilisation was destroyed, yet
the invasion itself led to the conversion of the invaders.
Resolved to remain in the country which they had
conquered, to cultivate the lands which they had divided
among themselves, they were compelled to enter into
relations of amity with the inhabitants, from whose
example, or by whose persuasion, they soon embraced
the faith of Christ. That the Danish princes were soon
no less devout than their Saxon brothers appears from
the splendid donation of all the country between the
Wear and the Tyne, made by Guthred to the cathedral
of St. Cuthbert, now transferred to Chester-le-Street.”
Out of evil comes good,—a proof of God’s particular
providence.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c017'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>868
to
876.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But the atrocities of the Northmen at this period are
most graphically described by the abbot Ingulf. After
the destruction of Bardney, the pirates hastened to the
monastery of Croyland. “It was midnight: the abbot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Theodore and his monks had risen to matins when the
enemy drew near: the younger brethren the abbot immediately
commanded to seek a place of refuge, with
their papers, relics, and jewels; while he himself,
accompanied by the more aged monks, and some children,
awaited whatever fate might be reserved for them.
Perhaps he hoped that the grey locks of some, and the
infancy of others, might awaken pity even in pagans.
But they forgot, says Ingulf, the old verse,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nulla fides pictasque viris qui castra sequuntur.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>But he was prepared for any event,—to live or fall
with his establishment. Having taken an affectionate
leave of about thirty junior monks, he and his devoted
companions returned to the church, finished the matins,
and celebrated mass. They had just communicated
when the pagans arrived, forced the gates, and rushed
into the cloisters. The silence which they found might
have induced them to believe the monastery was utterly
forsaken, had not the distant chaunting of the monks
fallen on their ears. They hastened to the church and
burst into the choir; one chieftain instantly seized the
abbot by the hair with his left hand, while the right
severed the head from the body. The officiating clergy
shared the same fate at nearly the same moment: the
children and the aged monks were tortured for the
purpose of discovering whither the treasures had been
conveyed; but as the former were unable, and the
latter unwilling, to disclose the secret, their sufferings
were soon terminated by death. Of all these helpless
inmates, one only was saved,—a boy ten years old,
whose innocence made an impression on one of the
chieftains. He had fled to the refectory with the sub-prior,
whom he saw murdered, and whose fate he begged
to share; but the chieftain tore the cowl from his head,
threw a Danish cloak over him, and commanded him to
follow him. The three succeeding days were passed in
plunder,—in minutely examining every corner or crevice
where treasure might be buried. The shrine of St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Guthlake was overthrown; the marble monuments
around it, containing the mortal remains of saints and
benefactors to the house, were opened, in search of
rings, chalices, and other precious effects which the
Saxons entombed with the bodies of the great; the
bones were thrown on the ground, and the sculpture
defaced. On the fourth day the extensive pile was on
fire. Medeshamstede, or Peterborough, also an abbey
of royal foundation, was next visited. Its noble library,
its numerous treasures, which there had not been time
to remove, its magnificent architecture, rendered it one
of the proudest monastic establishments in the island.
Within its gates many of the neighbouring inhabitants
had placed their most valuable effects, and thither many
had fled for protection. For a while the edifice made
a noble stand; but a stone thrown by an unknown
hand having mortally wounded the brother of Ubbo,
the Danish king, the barbarian and his followers made
a more desperate attack, forced the gates, and commenced
the massacre. With his own hand Ubbo sacrificed
the hoary abbot and eighty-three monks to the
shade of his brother; while the strangers fell under the
hands of his followers. The booty was immense; but
the value was trifling compared with that of the MS.
treasures which were consumed with the monastery.
The conflagration continued a fortnight. While it
raged, the monks who had fled from Croyland returned
to their former abode, sat themselves down amidst the
smoking ruins, and wept. So overcome were they by
the melancholy sight, that some time elapsed before they
proceeded to bury the scorched bodies of their brethren.
Having performed this sad office, and elected another
abbot, they were solicited to perform the last duties to
the monks of Medeshamstede. With sorrowful hearts
they deposited the bones of the abbot and the eighty-three
monks in the same grave, over which Godric,
their superior, raised a monument, engraven with the
history of this sad tragedy. From Medeshamstede the
pirates, exulting in their success, hastened to the Isle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>of Ely, to inflict the same fate on the flourishing convent
which had been founded by the piety of St. Edilthryda.
Its cloisters were inhabited by the noblest
ladies of England. Some fled; but the greater number
preferred the death which they knew awaited them.
The place was taken; the nuns were ravished and
slaughtered; and the holy pile was reduced to ashes.
That such atrocities could be committed would be incredible
were they not too well attested to admit of
scepticism.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c017'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The struggles of Alfred with the ferocious Northmen
have been detailed in more than one volume connected
with the present.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c017'><sup>[276]</sup></a> During this period, there was a
Danish monarchy in Northumbria, which, as we have
already observed, had been probably founded by the
sons of Ragnar Lodbrog. That monarchy subsisted in
the reign of Edmund, the son of Alfred; and, it was in
full vigour on the accession of Athelstane. So powerful,
indeed, was Sigtrug, king of that province, that Athelstane,
to insure his friendship, conferred on him the
hand of his sister. The condition of this marriage was
that Sigtrug should embrace Christianity, and become
the vassal of Athelstane. In five years, however, the
restless barbarian put away his wife, and relapsed into
idolatry. To punish the insult, Athelstane invaded
Northumbria; but Sigtrug died before his arrival; and
the two sons of Sigtrug, Anlaf and Godfrey, fled,—the
former into Ireland, the latter into Scotland; and
Athelstane annexed Northumbria to his English crown.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c017'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>924
to
934.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>That Athelstane should so immediately raise the
power of the Saxon kingdom, as not only to defeat the
Danes and Northmen, but to subjugate a province which
had always been hostile to it, shows what may be
effected by the energies of a single mind. Not satisfied
with expelling the enemy from Northumbria, he pursued
them into Scotland, far north of the boundary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>which had hitherto arrested the progress of English
victory: his fleets penetrated into Caithness, ravaging
the coast as they proceeded. And he is believed, at
this period, to have located a multitude of English colonists
in the southern provinces of Scotland, and thus
to have laid the foundation of the present lowland population.
But Northumbria was too recent a conquest,
and too dissimilar from the rest of the monarchy, to
remain secure. The chiefs of Denmark and Norway,
who had so long regarded England as a kind of inheritance,
armed in greater numbers than before, to check
the rising power of Athelstane. They were joined by
all the noted sea kings of the age; by many of the
jarls or kings who had settlements in Ireland and Scotland;
by the king of the Scots, and by several Welsh
chiefs. Never, we are told, had so formidable an
armament menaced England as that which, in 934,
entered the Humber. It consisted of 615 ships, headed
by Anlaf, whom Constantine of Scotland had induced
to make the attempt. Anlaf, who, on his father’s death,
had obtained for himself a principality in Ireland, had
a reputation for skill and valour equalled by none of
his countrymen. Of the two thanes whom Athelstane
had placed over Northumbria, one was defeated and
slain; the other, after the battle, fled to acquaint the
English monarch with the defeat. He prepared for the
contest with courage; and, to gain time until his forces
were collected, entered into negotiations. When his
army was completed, he hastened into the north, and
was in presence of the pirates before they knew he had
left the Saxon provinces. If any faith is to be placed
in either Saxon or Norwegian writers, Anlaf, assuming
the disguise of a harper, penetrated to the tent of
Athelstane, and entertained that monarch with his art.
His object, we are told, was to ascertain the position of
the tent previous to a nocturnal attack, which had been
determined by the confederate chiefs. But this incident,
no less than the recognition of Anlaf by one of
the Saxon outposts, is too romantic to be easily credited.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>What appears to be certain is, that Athelstane removed
his tent to another part of the field; and that the bishop
of Sherburn, who encamped in the place which he had
abandoned, was slain before the morning’s dawn. In
the night there was a skirmish, which caused much
effusion of blood, and was advantageous to neither party.
When day arrived, the celebrated battle of Brunanburgh
was fought. That town has escaped the researches
of antiquaries; and all that can be conjectured
is, that it was in some place north of the Humber.
That the struggle was a desperate one might be inferred
alike from the character of the combatants, and
from the magnitude of the interests involved. Victory
declared for Athelstane; Constantine of Scotland was
nearly taken, and his son killed; the Cumbrians and
Britons and Irish were destroyed, or put to flight, and
the bravest warriors of the north remained on the field.
This splendid advantage raised England in the esteem
of all Europe, and impressed the Northmen with a
salutary terror.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c017'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

Ethelred II., and eventually became king of

that of the Scandinavian expeditions to the year 1014.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>France.</i> The devastations of the Saxons and
the Jutes on the coasts of Gaul commenced as early as
those on the coast of Britain. We read of them in the
third and every succeeding century, until France was
too strong to be assailed with impunity,—until piracy
was extinguished in the north of Europe. In the fifth
century, the pirates besieged Orleans, and formed many
settlements on the western coast. About the middle of
the sixth, Hamlet of Jutland is said to have fought the
Franks in person, and to have been defeated. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>period, however, of Hamlet, is purely conjectural; and
his descent on the coast is equally so. But that the
Normans were there is affirmed by the contemporary
Gregory of Tours, who describes their ravages with
much interest. Under the Carlovingians, the piratical
armaments were more powerful than at any preceding
time. In 795, the Danes ravaged Friesland; from
800, the coasts of Flanders and France were infested;
nor could the genius and vast resources of Charlemagne
punish their audacity. On witnessing their fugitive
depredations, he is said to have predicted the trouble
which they would cause his successors. Such a prediction
required no supernatural discernment; but it
proves that the monarch had formed a correct estimate
of northern piracy. For the greater part of a century,
however, they did not appear in any overwhelming
numbers on the French coast. The forces of the Northmen
were too much scattered over the deep, in England,
Ireland, the Orkneys, and the Baltic, to admit of any
considerable concentration at a given point. Their
efforts, however destructive, were desultory, and might
have been easily repelled, had there been any wisdom
or any vigour in the government. But the sons
of the emperor Louis were too eager to destroy each
other, to have time for the chastisement of obscure
pirates; and every year added to the severity of the
scourge. In 840, Rouen was burnt; and many great
monasteries of that province, defended as they were by
numerous vassals, shared the same fate. The banks of
two rivers—the Seine and the Loire—were ravaged
from their mouths to the interior of France. Amboise
was next burnt, and Tours was besieged; but St. Martin
saved his city.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c017'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>840.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The man whose ravages were to eclipse all former
pirates was Hastings, who headed the expedition into
Touraine. Of him we have no mention in the annals
of the north; our only information respecting him is
from the French writers,—Dudo of St. Quentin, William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>of Jumvieges, William of Poictiers, Orderic Vital,
Robert Wace, and Benedict of St. Maur. In this absence
of Scandinavian authority, the critics of the north
have endeavoured to identify him with such of the
Swedish, Danish, or Norwegian chiefs, as bore a name
kindred with his own. But the account of Wace, however
inaccurate in its details, is the only one that can
be followed. There was a king of Denmark, says this
ecclesiastic, Lotroc, an old man, who had a son called
Biorn, surnamed Ironside, from his defensive armour.
Finding that his kingdom was too populous, he revived
an ancient law, which forced all the sons of a family
except one, to seek their fortunes on the deep. A considerable
number of vessels being prepared, Biorn was
placed over the fleet; but, as his years were yet tender,
he was subjected to the councils of Hadding, or Hasting,
a veteran chief of the pirates. Who was this king?
Modern writers unanimously affirm that he was the
celebrated Ragnar Lodbrog. In this case, Biorn could
be no other than Biorn Ironside, who, on the death of
his father in 794, ascended the throne of the Swedes.
Yet how will this chronology agree with the facts?
The expedition of Hastings must be referred to the
middle of the ninth century; when, if any dependence
is to be placed on the critical historians of the north,
Biorn had been dead forty years. But wherever the
name of this Lodbrog occurs, there is the same chronological
confusion; nor can we be surprised that Suhm
makes two heroes of that name,—one of the eighth, the
other of the ninth century.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c017'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>842
to
844.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>When Hastings arrived off the coast, he divided his
fleet into two squadrons. One ascended the Somme,
set fire to the towns which lay on its banks, and murdered
the inhabitants. The other proceeded to the mouth
of the Loire, and committed the same depredations on
its banks. Nantes was taken, and all who had sought
refuge in the cathedral were put to death. Churches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>monasteries, towns, hamlets,—everything which lay in
the passage of the invaders, was destroyed. Proceeding
to the south, they ravaged the coasts of Galicia, but
were defeated by the king of Leon. This check forced
them from Spain; but they spread their wild hordes
over the south of France, from Thoulouse to the Pyrenees.
As they had established a kind of wooden
fortress on the Loire, they now erected one on the
Garonne. But they were not satisfied with the failure
of their arms against Spain; they were determined, by
future successes, to blot out the memory of this disgrace;
and, with a larger fleet, they returned to that
peninsula. Lisbon, then an inconsiderable town, was
plundered; passing to the south and east, the armament
ascended the Guadalquivir, and assailed the important
city of Seville, then in the power of the Mohammedans.
Strange was the chance which thus brought the robbers
of Scandinavia and those of the Arabian deserts into
collision with each other. But the followers of Odin
had the advantage over those of Mohammed; doubtless
because the latter were few in number, and unprepared
for the attack. From this city they made some predatory
excursions into the neighbouring country; but
the Arabs, by surprising a part of their fleet, counter-balanced
the advantage they had just gained.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c017'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>845
to
859.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Whether Hastings was present in the expedition
to Spain may be doubted. There were several chiefs
of the pirates, from all parts of Scandinavia; and
while one was laying waste the maritime coasts of
the South, others were equally active on those of
France. Hastings, however, was at the head of the
party which, proceeding by way of Fescamp and
Rouen, extended its ravages over most of Neustria
and Bretagne, and even to the gates of Paris. All
France was in consternation. The monks especially
were surprised that their holy relics had no power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>to arrest the progress of the barbarians. St. Martin
had saved Tours; but there was no saint to defend the
magnificent religious houses which were now destroyed
by the Northmen. When the enemy approached, the
monks retired with the relics, heaping curses loud and
deep on these “men of hell,” these “spawn of the
devil.” But their curses were ineffectual as their relics,
and the tide of destruction flowed on. Many were the
presents which the Carlovingian kings made to the invaders
to remove the scourge. As in England, the
money was received, but the depredations were only
transferred to some other part of the kingdom. But,
so many were the armaments which every year arrived
from the North, and so many the chiefs to be bribed,
that the resources of the country were insufficient for
the purpose. It was probably this circumstance which
led Hastings into the Mediterranean. He had heard
of Rome; and the glory no less than the advantage of
sacking that celebrated city, led him to the shores of
Italy. On his way, he plundered the coasts of Spain,
of Africa, and those of the islands which he passed.
Disembarking in Tuscany, he assailed Luna, which he
is absurdly said to have mistaken for Rome; and failing
in his attempt to carry it by storm, he recurred to
an experiment which we have more than once read
in the history of the north. He caused the inhabitants
to be informed that he was disgusted with his
manner of life; that he would repent; that he was the
victim of an incurable disease; that he wished to be
baptized before his death. The credulous ecclesiastics
obtained a suspension of hostilities, and prepared for
the ceremony which was “to wash this Ethiop white.”
On the day appointed, he was carried in a litter to the
cathedral; and he acted his part to admiration. He
received the holy rite with much appearance of devotion;
all must see that his days were drawing to their
close; and he begged that his bones might be deposited
in one of the vaults beneath the church. That was
sacred ground; and when surrounded by the ashes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>saints and martyrs, he might hope to escape the pursuits
of the evil one. Who could refuse so humble a
request? He was borne to his ship, which he was
scarcely expected to see alive. No sooner was he on
board, than he cast away his disease, and mentioned to
his followers the plan which he had devised for the
capture of the city. In a short time, a loud cry of
grief was heard on board his vessel; the neophyte was
dead, and preparations were made for the funeral.
When the day appointed by the clergy arrived, the
coffin, attended by all the chiefs, and a great number of
warriors, was slowly borne from the ship to the cathedral.
It was placed on a bier, near the choir of the
church, and the funeral service was commenced. The
congregation to witness the ceremony was great; it
comprised the bishop, the clergy, the governor, the
military, and the principal inhabitants. Mass was
sung; the funeral hymns were chaunted; prayers
for the requiem of the new-born soul were humbly
offered; and the attendants advanced to the bier to
lower the corpse into its last resting-place. At this
moment, Hastings arose; his warriors drew their
swords from beneath their long cloaks, which were at
once thrown on the pavement; the doors were fastened;
the work of carnage commenced, and every one present
was laid dead in the place. The city was easily won;
the inhabitants were massacred; the most precious
effects borne to the ships, and the city consumed by
fire. This may seem to be romance rather than history;
but it is attested by so many writers, and is so conformable
with the character of the pagan Scandinavians
at once violent and treacherous that we dare
not wholly reject it. The circumstances may be embellished;
but the foundation of the story is probably
true.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c017'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>While Hastings was in Italy, Biorn was pursuing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>work of destruction in France. In vain did Charles
the Bald endeavour to expel him from the kingdom.
Arms being ineffectual, negotiation was tried, and for a
large sum Biorn consented to leave France. On his
return, feeling that he was indisposed, he landed on the
coast, and there died. While the French were congratulating
themselves on this unexpected deliverance, they
were thrown into consternation by the news that Hastings
was just returned from Italy, and renewing his
ravages. A misfortune which he had sustained on the
passage—that of being compelled through the violence
of the storm to throw overboard his numerous captives
and most precious effects—made him the more eager to
repair his fortunes. Entering the Rhone, and forming
another entrenchment, he sent or headed detachments,
which plundered Arles, Nismes, and most of the towns
between the Alps and the Pyrenees. While thus occupied,
another formidable body in the Seine, which had
not shared in the treaty made by Biorn, ravaged the
country to the gates of Paris. A third soon landed
from the north, and commenced its career by the
destruction of Amiens; while a fourth was equally
mischievous in Flanders. Charles had, as before, recourse
to negotiation. To the party which had destroyed
Amiens he engaged to pay three thousand pounds
weight of fine gold—an immense sum, and surely an
exaggeration. It is, however, certain that a heavy tax
was levied on the whole kingdom, and that in twelve
months it was not wholly collected. But while the
negotiation was pending, other armaments arrived, and
even the king began to perceive that to purchase the
retreat of one while so many others were left to pursue
their depredations, was great folly. The negotiation,
consequently, assumed a new character: and
the pirates were now to be paid, not for leaving the
kingdom, but for assisting to expel other bodies of their
countrymen from it. Accordingly, there followed some
desultory hostilities between these kindred robbers: but
while they were thus occupied, other bands were carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>their depredations into the heart of France. In the
end, however, two of the armaments were persuaded to
leave the shores—probably to join in the conquest of
England, now governed by the feeble brothers of Alfred.
But two yet remained that of Hastings, and one
stationed in the Loire. As the former was so dreaded,
his neutrality, at least, was to be purchased on any terms.
The abbot of St. Denis repaired to the head quarters of
the chief, and with some difficulty prevailed on him to
accept the royal offers. These were, a large sum of
money, and the fief of Chartres with the title of count,
on the condition of his embracing Christianity, and, as
a French vassal, of aiding his liege superior against all
enemies. The conditions were accepted, and the fierce
pirate of the Baltic became one of the noblest peers of
France.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c017'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>863
to
876.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>There now remained one piratical band only,—that
on the Loire. As Paris had been more than once
menaced, king Charles caused to be constructed on the
Seine, below that city, a bridge, which was intended to
arrest the progress of the hostile vessels, by its inability
to admit the high masts. The writers of that period
are minute in describing the excesses of these men,
whom they accompany step by step. But the detail is
tedious: in general they have more sympathy for churches
and abbeys, than for the peasantry; and much louder
is their cry when a solitary priest is massacred at the
altar, or a sacred relic borne away, than when a town
is put to the sword. No church, no monastery, no
village or town was spared,—nothing which had not the
means of self-defence. In 867 the robbers appeared
in the vicinity of Paris: the bridge prevented their
arriving under the walls; and they established their
head quarters at the abbey of St. Denis. From thence
they spread into the neighbouring country, and acquired
immense booty. But a contagious disease appearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>among them, and reducing their numbers, they slowly
descended the river to wait for reinforcements, which
were constantly arriving on the coast. But these reinforcements
were now smaller than they had lately
been: three fourths of all the pirates that swept the
seas were in England, preparing to drive Alfred from
the throne; and though those who remained in France
effected great mischief, they would have been unable to
resist any considerable body. They were not, however,
inured to open campaigns: their hostilities were
undertaken on a smaller scale,—were generally directed
against some town or religious edifice where
there was less danger of resistance; and when assailed
(as was sometimes the case) by a much superior force,
they retired into their fortified places. Angers, which
they captured in 873, was one of these. On this occasion
Charles the Bald exhibited an energy to which
he was usually a stranger. He raised an army, marched
to Angers, compelled the Northmen to evacuate it,
and retire to their island entrenchments on the Loire.
From this place their predatory excursions were resumed.
But they are beneath the notice of history:
they were undertaken, not for conquest, but for booty.
The period, however, is arrived when we must accompany
the exploits of one who did conquer, and who
laid the foundation of a state powerful enough to effect
the greatest revolutions in Europe.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c017'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Rognevald was one of the jarls of Harald the Fair-haired.
After serving his monarch in many difficult
and dangerous enterprises, he fell in battle. Of his
sons, one, Einar, became jarl of the Orkneys. Einar
was an ambitious man. When Halfdan, a son of
Harald, expelled him from their island, he obtained
reinforcements in Scotland, returned to the charge,
and deprived Halfdan of authority and life. Harald
sailed to avenge the death of his son; but Einar was
left in possession of the government. Not inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>to Einar in ambition or valour, was <i>Hrolf</i>, or <i>Rollo</i>,—the
<i>Rou</i> of the Norman writers,—another son of
Rognevald. According to the Icelandic sagas, he was
so tall and so robust that no horse could carry him:
hence his appellation of Hrolf <i>Gangr</i>, or the Walker.
Like his ancestors, he passed his time on the deep, and
enriched himself by his depredations on the shores of the
Baltic. The death of his father, and the rebellion of his
elder brother, made him probably less attached to the interests
of Harald, or less obedient to his commands. It is
certain that he ventured to do what had been so rigorously
forbidden,—to make a piratical descent on the
Norwegian coast. The monarch was in the town which
Rollo endeavoured to sack; and his indignation at the
attempt led him to banish the pirate for ever. Whether
this could be much punishment to one whose life had
been passed far from Norway may be doubted. Collecting
as great a number of vessels as were willing to
join him,—and the dignity of his family no less than
his own prowess made him a popular chief,—he sailed
for France. In his way he appears to have made some
piratical descents on the Scottish and English coasts;
and though he could not make much impression on
either, he did what, in his present circumstances, was quite
as advantageous—he loaded his ships with booty. Dudo
of St. Quentin, and Wace, determined that the founder
of the Norman dynasty shall be a favourite of heaven,
introduce some visions and other miscellaneous appearances,
which the historian must leave to the monastic
chronicler. These are harmless, and may be despised;
but when, to dignify the chief of some great family,
history is perverted, a severer censure is necessary.
Thus, Dudo (who is followed by many Norman
writers) informs us that Rollo was powerful enough to
become the ally and friend of Alfred; that by the
Saxon monarch he was provided with a fleet to make
war on the French king; that in gratitude for this aid
he afterwards assisted Alfred—whom his subjects or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Danes had dethroned—to reascend the throne. How
living writers could fall into the absurdity of receiving
such statements, which are contrary to the unanimous
voices of contemporary history, is surprising.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c017'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>876
to
888.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The year in which Rollo arrived in the south is not
very clearly established. Schoning has 995; but this
will not bear the test of scrutiny, for the French and
Norman writers assert that he was occupied above thirty
years in his subjugation of Normandy, and we know
that he was recognised its duke in 912. Asser of St.
David’s—a contemporary—has the year 876, and he
is confirmed by the writers nearest to the period; yet
there are some chronological difficulties which we cannot
remove. Harald of Norway did not undertake the
voyage to the Orkneys before the year 895; and the
banishment of Rollo is assigned to the year following.
The only way to reconcile this anachronism is by the
conjecture that Rollo, being exiled for piracy in 876,
joined his countrymen and the Danes, who were ravaging
England and France; that he established himself
at Rouen, but frequently extended his devastations to
the north and east of that city; that he was more than
once in England, and perhaps in the north, before his
recognition as duke of Normandy. But let us follow
his footsteps. Landing at Walcheren, he defeated the
count of Hainault, whom he captured, and exacted a
heavy sum by way of ransom. Repairing to Rouen, he
was not so ruthless as to destroy it: he accepted from
the archbishop a sum of money, fortified it, and made
it the basis of his operations against the French king.
His arrival threw France into consternation; and
Hastings was sent to learn his object, which he coolly
replied was—conquest. But whether at this period he
proceeded far in his operations may well be doubted.
His name does not appear in the siege of Paris, which
took place in 886, nor in many other enterprises which
from 876 to 896—that is, twenty years—afflicted France.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Yet the names of other chiefs are specified. As we
have already conjectured, he was probably for some
years in England, or in the north. Certainly he
could not have entered on that splendid career which
led to his elevation, before the year 890, or later still.
Yet it is possible that he might be joined with
the other chiefs in the devastations which, from 876,—during
full thirty years,—afflicted the whole of France.
However this be, in ten years after his first disembarkation,
siege was laid to Paris. It is described by a contemporary
poet,—by an eye-witness, Abbo, monk of
Fleury. It was of considerable duration, and many
were the desperate assaults which were made upon the
city; but they were as bravely repelled; and the siege
was raised. Yet the Northmen did not retire further
than the abbey of St. Germain’s, where they continued
for some time to despatch their destructive hordes.
As no great enemy was before them, they split into
two bodies; and while one was collecting booty and
burning villages, another laid siege to Chartres. In
this attempt, however, they failed,—a result which
Wace ascribes to the virtue of a certain relic.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c017'><sup>[288]</sup></a> A new
attack was made on Paris, but with as little effect. At
this juncture arrived the emperor Charles the Fat, to
succour the capital; and the expulsion of the pirates
seemed inevitable. But far different was the result:
without striking a blow, he negotiated, and agreed to
give the pirates seven hundred pounds of gold, with
permission to ravage the two sides of the Seine into
Burgundy, provided they would then leave—not France,
but the central provinces. They received the money,
and ravaged Burgundy; but they had no intention to
forsake the fertile plains of the interior for the dreary
maritime coast.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c017'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>888
to
896.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Though Eudes defeated the pirates, this was merely
a temporary check,—so temporary as scarcely to arrest
their progress. Meaux was besieged and taken; Champagne,
Lorraine, and Burgundy were ravaged; Troyes,
Chalons, Toul, Verdun were occupied; Picardy and
Artois, to the borders of the sea, were laid waste. Contemporaneously
with these rapid successes were the
depredations of the pirates who were still entrenched
on the Loire. There was no rest for France; no hope
of expelling her daring intruders. Though Eudes had
triumphed over the pirates, the next time they assailed
that capital he was glad to purchase their retreat. Descending
the river to its mouth, they next assailed the
fortress of St. Loo. It was compelled to capitulate;
but no conditions were binding on these wretches, who
regarded oaths as vain formalities: instead of security
for their lives, the inhabitants found a grave. Bretagne
was now ravaged; but duke Alan was braver and more,
fortunate than Eudes. Though the invaders were
15,000 in number, he assailed them, at a moment, too,
when they were flushed with victory over a rival duke.
His success was splendid; thousands were left dead on
the field; the rest were put to flight. But even this
success was scarcely a check to these wild sons of the
deep. Driven from England by the genius of Alfred,
they came in fearful numbers to France. They occupied
both the coasts and the centre; and they traversed
every part of the kingdom with an impunity surprising
to posterity.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c017'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>896
to
909.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In how many of these embassies Rollo was an actor,
we shall not venture to decide. Whether he was not
much in England, as well as in France; whether he
was not alternately engaged in both kingdoms, must be
left to the reader’s own inference. This, at least, is
certain, that from the year 896 his name and exploits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>fill the page of French history, to the exclusion of
many other names which had before occupied it. From
that year, too, must be dated those rapid and decisive
successes which insured his future greatness. The banishment
of so many pirates from the north by Harald Harfager
now sent larger swarms to the south. The first care
of Rollo was to strengthen the fortifications of Rouen,
which had been destroyed in his absence (whether that
absence were in England, or the interior of France, we
will not decide), and which he now made formidable.
Next, both sides of the Seine felt the vigour of
his genius. The forces which were sent to oppose
him he defeated. But we cannot follow his steps.
Let it be sufficient to observe, that he was almost
uniformly successful; that in several battles he was the
victor; that Bayeux, Evreux, Nantes, and many
places of inferior note were taken by him; that he
partitioned the lands which he subdued among his warriors,
to be held of him as the liege head, under the
usual feudal conditions. From this policy and this
success, we should infer that he was in one respect the
counterpart of his countrymen—that he protected,
instead of destroying, the peasantry—that he encouraged,
instead of abolishing, Christianity. Probably
much of his moderation was owing to the councils of
Franco, archbishop of Rouen, his chief vassal. Alarmed
at the progress of his arms, Charles the Simple applied
through Franco for a truce, which was readily granted.
There can, indeed, be little doubt that the success of
Hastings was before the eyes of Rollo, and that he
aspired to a lordship much more ample than Chartres,—one
which he should compel the French king to cede
to him, and thereby give him a proud seat amongst the
princes of Europe. Hence the readiness with which
he listened to Franco, especially when assured that
Charles had already contemplated his investiture with
some portion of his new conquests. The truce, indeed,
was not agreeable to some of the French peers, and
hostilities were recommenced, much to the injury of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>France. There was not a province which some of his
bands did not traverse; there was scarcely one which he
did not plunder; and though frequently repulsed, they
always returned to the charge. The French began to
murmur, and Charles to apply himself still more
seriously to a permanent understanding with Rollo.
Hostilities had availed nothing; France had lost many
thousands of her bravest defenders, and hundreds of
thousands of her peaceful inhabitants; and if the invaders
had also lost many considerable detachments,
their ranks were speedily replenished by new immigrations
from the north.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c017'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>910
to
912.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>About the year 910, or perhaps the year following,
Franco, at the command of Charles, opened the important
negotiation with this adventurer. The offers were—Neuctria
with the ducal title, and the hand of Gisele,
a natural daughter of the king, provided he would embrace
Christianity, and become the liege vassal of the
French crown. This prelate was an eloquent, persuasive
man, and had already considerable influence over
the mind of Rollo. But that chief objected to one of
the conditions as not sufficiently liberal. Neuctria he
had already; and there was no great generosity in
recognising his title to that which nobody could wrest
from him. Besides, it was, he alleged, barren and half-peopled;
but he forgot that this result was his own
work and that of his countrymen. Franco then offered
a portion of Bretagne—perhaps the whole—as an
arriere-fief; and Rollo no longer hesitated. He had
a wife already, Popa, the daughter of a French count;
and her he repudiated,—on what ground is matter of
dispute; but surely there need be none. Rollo was
not yet a Christian; he had not been married in any
Christian church; how then could the church recognise
the union? Gisele, therefore, was to become the bride
of the chief. A meeting of Rollo and of Charles was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>appointed at St. Clair-sur-Epte, a place on the frontier
of Normandy. In 912, both repaired to that town,—Charles
with a splendid retinue of nobles and prelates,
by whose advice he had entered into a treaty with the
new vassal. Here the investiture took place; Rollo did
homage to the sovereign, and both acts were witnessed
by the French nobles. To kneel before the monarch,
hold up his hands between those of the superior,
and repeat a certain formula called an oath, were
no great acts of degradation; and to these Rollo had no
objection. But the homage was not complete until the
regal foot was kissed. To this humiliation he would
not stoop, and he was allowed to perform it by deputy.
A warrior of his suite was accordingly brought
forward; but he was no less proud than his master;
and on the royal foot being somewhat raised, he raised it
still higher, and threw the poor monarch on his back,
amidst the suppressed laughter of the assembly.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c017'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>912.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>Thus was a fierce, an obscure pirate invested with
one of the most important fiefs in Europe. His successors
were, like him, valiant and politic; and by their
means the duchy was raised to a height of power
that rendered it a rival at once to the French and
English kings. By what degrees, however, this progressive
greatness was achieved, must be left to the
historian of France. It is sufficient for us to observe
that the new state became a successful barrier against
the pagans of Scandinavia. Not that, both in Bretagne
and Gascony, new armaments did not arrive and do some
mischief; but it was transient, and no fear was entertained
that the most powerful cities of France would
ever again be assailed by them. When they did appear
in any district, they were soon repulsed. The policy,
therefore, of erecting Neustria into a state, and confiding
it to the government of a race of heroes, was a wise one.
A successor of Charles the Simple endeavoured to dethrone
a grandson of Rollo; but, as we have already
seen, Harald of Denmark sailed to the aid of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>young duke, took the French king prisoner, and restored
the relation between duke and monarch to the state in
which it was on the death of Rollo.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c017'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>3. <i>Ireland.</i> At what period the Northmen first
commenced their depredations in Ireland is, like many
other points of northern history, impossible to be
established. The Irish annals themselves contain no
record of such transactions prior to the eighth century;
yet they must have happened before. If little reliance
is to be placed on the statement of Saxo, that Fridleif
I. and Frode III. conquered and plundered Dublin,
it would be rash to affirm that there was
not a very ancient intercourse between that island
and Scandinavia. Whether the Lochlans, or Dwellers
of the Lakes, were Scandinavians, or the Scottish Highlanders,
has been matter of great dispute. We know,
however, that, in the ninth century, the Danes were
expressly called Lochlans by the Irish, and that the
term was used at an earlier period to designate some
maritime people with whom the natives had a frequent
intercourse. The term, however, might be applied to
both the Gael and the Northmen,—to all maritime
nations. On this subject let us hear the last and most
eloquent of Irish historians:—</p>

<p class='c024'>In proof of the Danes having been the people with whom
this early intercourse was maintained, the authority of a number
of modern historians has been adduced, according to whose
accounts it would seem that, from a period preceding the birth
of Christ, a succession of invasions of this island from Denmark
had been commenced; and that, for some centuries after, a
course of alternate hostility and friendship marked the relations
between the two countries. Imposing, however, as is
the array of northern authorities for this statement, the entire
value of their united evidence may be reduced to that of the
single testimony of that of Saxo Grammaticus, from whose
pages they have all copied; and it is well known, for all the
earlier portion of this eloquent writer’s history, the foundation
is as unsound and unreal as Scaldic fable and fallacious chronology
could make it. The only circumstance that lends any
semblance of credit to the accounts given by northern histotorians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of the early fortunes of Ireland, is the known fact
that the chief materials of their own history were derived from
records preserved in Iceland: to which island inaccessible as it
might seem to have been to the rude navigation of those days,
it is certain that a number of Irish missionaries of the seventh
and eighth centuries contrived to find their way. We learn,
from more than one authentic source, that, when the Norwegians
first arrived in Iceland, they found there traces of its
having been previously inhabited by a Christian people; and
the Irish books, bells, and holy staves, left behind by the
former dwellers, sufficiently denoted the religious island from
whence they had migrated. The title of Papas, which it
appears was borne by them, has led to the conclusion that they
must have been Irish priests who had adventurously fixed
themselves in this desolate region; and, under the same name,
they were found in the Orkneys when the Norwegians conquered
those islands. Unless we were to suppose, however,
that among the books left by those missionaries in Iceland,
there were any relating to Irish history of which the chroniclers
consulted by Saxo might have availed themselves, the
incident, though curious and well attested, affords but slight
grounds for placing reliance on these early northern annals,
whose sources of information are known to have been spurious,
and to whose general character for extravagant fiction, the few
brief notices which they contain respecting Irish affairs, can
hardly be expected to furnish an exception. Nor is any more
serious credit due to them when they represent Dublin to have
been in possession of the Danes a short time before the birth
of Christ, than when they assert that London was built by
these northern people about the very same period. Fabulous,
however, as are these accounts, yet that, long before either the
Danish or even the Saxon invasions, the coasts of the Baltic
had sent forth colonies to the British Isles, is a fact to which
foreign as well as domestic tradition bears testimony. The
conjecture of Tacitus, that the people called Picts were a
Germanic or northern race, is confirmed by the traditional
accounts of this people, preserved in the chronicles of Britain;
and all the early Scandinavian legends concur with the annals
of Ireland in intimating, at some remote period, relations of
intercourse between the two countries. We have seen, in a
preceding part of this work, what almost certain grounds there
are for believing that those Scyths, or Scots, who, at the time
when Ireland first became known to modern Europe, formed
the dominant part of her people, were a colony from some
region bordering on the Baltic Sea which had, a few centuries
before, gained possession of this island. From whatever part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>these Scythian adventurers may have arrived, whether from
the Cimbric peninsula, the islands of the Baltic, or the Scandinavian
shores, it may be concluded that with that region the
occasional intercourse was afterwards maintained, and those
alliances and royal intermarriages formed of which, in our
ancient traditions and records, some scattered remembrances
still remain. With respect to those swarms of sea-rovers
who, throughout the dark and troubled period we are now approaching,
carried on their long career of havoc and blood,
though known most popularly in English history by the general
name of Danes, they are but rarely, and not till a late
period, thus designated in our annals. By Tigernach, the
earliest existing annalist, they are invariably called Gâll, or
Strangers; while, in the Annals of Inisfallen, of Ulster, and of
the Four Masters, they are styled indifferently either Galls,
Gentiles, Dwellers on the Lakes, or Pirates; but in not more
than two or three instances are they called Normans, and as
seldom Danes.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c017'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>795

820.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>We must be satisfied with the general inference that
Ireland was visited by the Northmen as soon, or nearly
as soon, as Scotland, and the Scottish islands. The first
visit of which we have any record was in 795, in the
reign of Aidan, monarch of the country. Leaving Iona,
the monastery of which they had laid in ashes, the
sea kings proceeded to the north-western coast, landed,
and ravaged the country as far as Roscommon. This
was, probably, the work of years: here, as everywhere
else, they would form intrenchments at the mouths of
the great rivers, the banks of which, for twenty leagues
round, they would lay waste as far as boats could ascend.
They appear to have been twelve years in the country
before any serious resistance was made. In 812 they
were defeated; but defeat, so long as the sea was open,
and communication with it maintained by navigable
rivers, was speedily repaired. In 815, a Norwegian
chief named Turges, or Thorgils, arrived with a more
powerful armament, and, during thirty years, was a
dreadful scourge not only to the northern, but to the
eastern and southern districts of the island. Their fury
was peculiarly directed against the holy places, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the monastery of Banchor and the cathedral of Armagh,
which they revisited and destroyed every time they
heard of their restoration. Every cell, every chapel,
every holy place to which the superstitious piety of the
age resorted, naturally attracted their notice. But in
the atrocities which they committed, and which the
unanimous voice of every kingdom they visited—from
Greece to Ireland—has immortalised, they must have
been actuated by other motives than the hope of gain.
If they were savage to the laity, they were demoniacal
to the ecclesiastics. Probably their superior ferocity in
the latter case may be explained by the deep hatred
which the persecutions of Charlemagne had produced
(as we have before intimated, under the term <i>Saxons</i>
must also be included the Scandinavians, and perhaps
some tribes of the great Slavonic family). But against
that great man, we are not disposed to join in the
hostility of some modern writers. The men with
whom the emperor had to deal were without honour,
without virtue of any kind, men who regarded
the most solemn oaths as empty sounds, who loved
war as much for the plunder which it brought as
for the gratification of shedding blood. But were not
the Saxons and Danes fighting for their liberties?
True, and the greatest of them was the liberty to
plunder the rest of the world,—to trample under foot
all humanity, all moral virtue,—to be the tyrants of
Europe. Charlemagne triumphed over them, and we
rejoice at his success; nor, had he exterminated the
whole people, should he be censured by posterity.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c017'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>820
to
848.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>The desolation which, at this period more than any
other, afflicted Ireland, might easily have been averted,
had there been a central government strong enough to
rally around it the hearts and arms of the people. But
the monarch was merely a titular one, and less powerful
than his vassals. Instead of harmony there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>dissension only among the members of the body politic;
and this evil was aggravated a hundred fold by the
mischievous practice of hiring the aid of strangers.
When, in 837, another powerful reinforcement arrived
from the north, and commenced its depredations on the
banks of the Liffey and the Boyne, the evil which, since
795, had afflicted the country, was increased a thousand
fold. There was not, says the eloquent historian of
Ireland, “a single spot of renown in the ecclesiastical
history of our country, not one of those numerous religious
foundations, the seats and monuments of the
early piety of her sons, that was not frequently, during
this period, made the scene of the most fearful and
brutal excesses.” Let it not be forgotten that this
frequency of destruction evinces the zeal of the Irish in
rebuilding their holy places, and the intrepidity with which
they repaired to them, even when assured that they
should be there met by incarnate demons, and sent to
aggrandise the “noble army of martyrs.” In general
the higher dignitaries were spared for the sake of the
ransom. The mischief was, that the head quarters of
Turges always presented a rallying-point for the defeated
Northmen, and for such new comers as arrived
on the coast. The way in which this veteran chief at
last met his fate, is romantically told by Giraldus de
Barri. He had fallen in love, says that amusing
Welchman, with the daughter of the king of Meath,
and he made known his love to the father. Pretending
to comply with his suit, a day was appointed on which
Turges, attended by fifteen followers, was to meet his
bride, accompanied by as many maidens, on a small
island of Loch-Var. To the place of meeting, however,
the Irish lady was escorted by fifteen young men in
the female garb, and they destroyed the tyrant. Probably
the relation of the native annalists, that he was drowned
in that lake by the king of Meath, is the true one. However
this be, his death was a fatal blow to the Scandinavian
power in Ireland. From this period (844) we read,
indeed, of their depredations, of their formidable combinations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>even of their victories; but there was no longer the
same hope, the same confidence in their invincibility.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c017'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>849
to
872.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>In 849, another powerful armament arrived from
the north. Their policy was not merely to plunder,
but to take advantage of the civil wars which desolated
Ireland, by hiring their services to the highest bidder.
In 850, they were employed by the monarch in his
contest with a native king, and the example was
speedily followed by his royal subjects. In this year,
too, we perceive that Dublin was in the power of the
Northmen, and one of their chief seats: probably it
had been so for half a century, or longer still. It was
fortunate for the Irish that the different Scandinavian
people who thus harassed them were often the enemies
of each other. Sometimes they fought under
the banners of Christian princes; at other times
they contended alone. Thus, in 850, the Dubh-Gals,
or black strangers, assailed the Fin-Gals, or white
strangers, of Dublin. Who were they? Were they
Scottish Highlanders? or were the former Slavonic,
the latter Scandinavian, pirates? This question can
never be answered to our entire satisfaction; but we
cannot easily believe that any chief of the Highlands
could equip so powerful an armament as that which
assailed the establishment of Dublin. Three years
afterwards, Anlaf, Ivar, and Sitric, all brothers, and
princes from Scandinavia, arrived with a great armament,
and seated themselves in three great stations,—Dublin,
Limerick, and Waterford. Probably the
last-named city was founded by Sitric. His two
brothers considerably extended their frontiers. They
appear, too, so far to have acted in concert as to compel
the Irish princes to pay them an annual tribute,—something
like the Danegelt, which was so oppressive to the
English. Anlaf, indeed, was a remarkable character;
but if the chronology be correct, which places his
arrival in the year 853, he must not be confounded
with the prince whom, in 924, Athelstane defeated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>His kingdom of Dublin, which comprehended the
county and much of its neighbourhood, was amplified
no less than defended by him, with success. Not that
advantages were not sometimes won from him. On
one occasion he was pursued into his capital, and his
territory wasted to its very gates. But this, at such a
period, when everything depended on a surprise, was a
very ordinary result; and that very month he might be
able to extend his ravages to the centre of the island.
That he frequently did so, we know,—sometimes alone,
sometimes in conjunction with his brothers, at other
times as the ally of the native princes. But that they
were always in the country does not appear probable.
If this Ivar be the man who was also king of Northumberland,
his territories in England must have frequently
required his presence. Anlaf, too, had a principality
on this side of the channel; for he is styled king
of all the Northmen in Ireland and Britain. But connected
with him, with his royal brothers, and their reputed
father, Ragnar Lodbrog, are so many chronological
difficulties, that we can never reconcile them. One of
these princes, according to the Annals of Ulster, died in
874; as all came in the middle of the century, none
could long survive that period; even then, if they were
the sons of the Ragnar who was killed in 794, and who
immediately afterwards descended on the Northumbrian
coast, they must have reached an age nearly centennial.
That there has been a sad confusion of names—for
all were common in the Scandinavian annals—is
undoubted. Then the confusion in the orthography of
proper words—Anlaf, for example, being written
Alaf, Olaf, Amlain, Amlaiph, &amp;c.—must add to the
hopelessness of the historian’s task. Three kings of
this name, all celebrated during the first half of the
ninth century, could not be the princes who, under the
same names, obtained so much celebrity during the first
half of the tenth. Either, therefore, the chronology is
wrong, or the events are for ever confounded. In this,
as in every other case, historians have adopted the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>mode of solution,—that there were two individuals of
the name existing at periods considerably removed from
each other.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c017'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>872
to
1000.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>For many years after this period, we read that the
Northmen were in possession of Dublin, Limerick, and
Waterford, the chiefs of which had the regal title.
Early in the tenth, indeed, they were expelled from the
first of these cities by the people of Leinster; but the
misfortune must have been soon repaired: for in a few
years afterwards, we find Godfrey, grandson of Ivar,
reigning there, and forcing tribute from most of the
princes in the south. In 926, however, the pirates
were signally defeated in Ulster, and eighty of their
chiefs slain. The moral effect of these victories could
be no other than to inspire the natives with new hope,
and to procure them new successes. In 936, a greater
loss was inflicted on the Scandinavians of Dublin. Five
years afterwards, a similar advantage was gained over
them; but either they must have had speedy means
of reinforcing themselves, or their losses must have
been grossly exaggerated. Nor could they be very unfortunate,
if it be true that after their partial conversion
to Christianity, in 948, they erected the great abbey of
St. Mary, in the vicinity of Dublin. Yet they were
sometimes tributary to Murkertach, one of the native
kings, and the most celebrated hero of his age; and
Dublin was frequently in the hands of the Irish;
but it was as frequently retaken. These alternations
of success and disaster comprehend the history of
the Northmen in Ireland. But after the accession
of Brian, surnamed Born, or the exacter of
tributes, the decline which had for above half a
century been visible in the affairs of the pirates, became
signally rapid.  Many were the successive engagements
in which that heroic chief had the advantage. In
969, he took and destroyed Limerick; in 972, he
recovered the island of Iniscathy, to which the natives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>attached no ordinary sanctity; in 980, a great confederation
of the pirates who had penetrated into the
heart of the country, were defeated by Malachi, the
monarch of Ireland. This last victory deserves more
than ordinary remembrance, from the fact that it gave
freedom to some thousands of Irish captives. In 989,
Dublin was besieged during twenty days by the
monarch of Ireland; and being forced to capitulate, it
agreed that every house should annually pay one ounce
of gold to the native hero. Probably this convention
was ill kept: for in 994, he was again before that city.
The success over the common enemy would have been
more signal, had not Brian and the titular monarch been
frequently at war with each other. But in 997, they
united their forces, and marched on Dublin. Three
years afterwards, we find the Danes as vassals in the
armies of Brian.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c017'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1000
to
1014.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c009'>But we must hasten over the obscure battles of the
period, and come at once to that which for ever broke
the Danish sceptre in Ireland. In 1014, the Danes,
having collected reinforcements from all parts of
Europe, and concentrated their strength on the plain
of Clontorf, fought a battle memorable in the Irish
annals. Fortunately for the natives, the same necessity
of combination made them for a moment suspend
their private feuds, and march to resist the common
enemy. Splendid was the victory which awaited Brian;
but he fell, being treacherously assassinated in his tent
in the hour of success. From this moment may be
dated the destruction of the gigantic enemy. Dying
struggles it exhibited, and struggles such as became a
giant; but the blow was struck; and, however lingering
the disease, the end was sure to be fatal.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c017'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c000'>
    <div>(<i>From Alban Butler’s Lives of the Saints.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>He</span> was son of Herald Grenscius, prince of Westfold in
Norway, by his wife Asta, daughter of Gulbrand Kuta,
governor of Gulbrand’s Dale or Valley. He delivered his
country from the tyranny under which the Swedes and Danes
had for some time held it, whilst Norway was divided between
Sweno, king of Denmark, Olave Scot-Konung, son of Eric
king of Sweden, and Eric, son of Hacon, earl of Norway. In
1013, he sailed to England, and successfully assisted king
Ethelred against the Danes after the death of Sueno, or Sweyn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>their king. He afterwards waged war against Olaus Scot-Konung,
king of Sweden, till, making an advantageous
peace, he took to wife the daughter of that king. These
two princes about that time introduced the Romescot, a
small annual tribute yearly to be paid to the apostolic see.
St. Olave brought over from England several pious and
learned priests and monks, one of whom, named Grimkele,
was chosen bishop of Drontheim, his capital. The holy king
did nothing without the advice of this prelate, and by his
counsels published many wholesome laws, and abolished such
ancient laws and customs as were contrary to the Gospel;
which he did not only in Norway, but also in the isles of
Orkney and of Iceland; though the entire conquest of Orkney
was reserved to his son Magnus, who also subdued the isle of
Man, as Cambden relates from the ancient Chronicle of
Man.</p>
<p class='c009'>Our religious king, having settled his dominions in peace,
set himself to extirpate out of them the abominable superstitions
of idolatry. He travelled in person from town to
town, exhorting his subjects to open the eyes of their souls to
the bright light of faith. A company of zealous preachers
attended him, and he demolished in many places the idolatrous
temples. The heathens rebelled, and with the assistance of
Canutus the Great, defeated and expelled him. St. Olave
fled into Russia, whence he soon after returned, and raised an
army in order to recover his kingdom, but was slain by his
rebellious and infidel subjects in a battle fought at Stichstadt,
north of Drontheim, on the 29th of July, 1030, having
reigned sixteen years. These rebels seem to have been in
the interest of Canute the Great, who arrived from England
in Norway, took possession of that kingdom, and left his
nephew Hackin viceroy; but he being soon after drowned at
sea, Canute made his son Sweno viceroy of Norway. St.
Olave’s body was honourably buried at Drontheim, and the
year following bishop Grimkele commanded him to be
honoured in that church among the saints with the title of
martyr. His son Magnus was called home from Russia in
1035, and restored to the throne. Sweno, who saw himself
entirely abandoned, fled into Sweden. Magnus exceedingly
promoted the devotion of the people to the memory of his
father, the martyr, who was chosen titular saint of the
cathedral of Drontheim. This church was rebuilt with such
splendour and magnificence as to have been the glory and
pride of all the north. Munster has given us a minute description
of it, after Lutheranism was introduced; but it was
soon after burnt by lightning. The body of St. Olave was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>found incorrupt in 1098; and again when the Lutherans, in
1541, plundered the shrine, which was adorned with gold
and jewels of an immense value, a treasure nowhere excelled
in the north. The ship which carried the greatest part of
this sacrilegious booty perished at sea in the road to Denmark;
the rest was robbed at land, so that nothing of it
came into the king of Denmark’s hands. The Lutherans
treated the saint’s body with respect, and left it in the same
place where the shrine had stood, in the inner wooden case,
till, in 1568, they decently buried it in the same cathedral. A
shirt or inner garment of St. Olave’s is shown at St. Victor’s
in Paris. His shrine became famous by many miracles, and
he was honoured with extraordinary devotion throughout all
the northern kingdoms, and was titular saint of several
churches in England and Scotland. He was called by our
ancestors St. Olave, and more frequently St. Tooley; but in
the Norway Chronicles Olaf Haraldson, and Olaf Helge, or
the Holy.</p>

<p class='c028'>In both lists, many of these names the reader will perceive to be identical
with the Danish kings given by Saxo Grammaticus. That the two lists
have been confounded there can be no doubt. And it as equally certain
that many of these kings are unnecessarily multiplied,—those allowed to
have reigned before, as well as after, the Christian era. Perhaps, however,
none of these princes reigned before Odin; probably all are more
recent still; and as so many were contemporary with each other, ample
lists have easily been formed.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vetustissima Regum Septentrionis Series Langfedgatal dicta. According
to this “Series,” the list of Danish kings prior to Odin is as follows:—<span class='sc'>Noah</span>,
Japhet, Zechim, Ciprus, Celius, Saturn of Crete, Jupiter, Darius,
Erichthon, Troes, Ilus, Laomedon, Priam of Troy, Memnon (the son-in-law
of Priam), Tror or Thor, Lorith, Einrith, Vingethar, Vingener, Moda,
Magus, Seskef, Bedoig, Athra, Iterman, Heremotr, Scealdna, Beaf, Eat,
Godulf, Finn, Frealaf—<span class='sc'>Odin</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Here is a precious list, and we should vainly inquire where it was originally
procured. One thing, however, is remarkable,—that of the immediate
predecessors of Odin, most are the same as those contained in the
Saxon Chronicle, in the genealogy of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Let us
now transcribe that of Saxo Grammaticus, who flourished in the twelfth
century, and is content with making Dan the ancestor of the Danes, about
a thousand years before Christ.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Dan I.</span>, Humble, Lother, Skiold, Gram, Swibdager, Guthrum, Hadding,
Frode I., Haldan, Roe and Helgo, Rolf or Rollo, Hoder, Ruric, Wiglet,
Guitlach, Wermund, Olaf I., Dan II., Hugleth, Frode II., Dan III., Fridleif,
Frode III. According to Saxo it was in the reign of Hadding that
Odin first appeared in the north. In this case, the reader may say Odin
must have flourished long before the period usually assigned, viz., <span class='fss'>A.C.</span> 70.
But most of these princes, doubtless, reigned <i>after</i> the birth of Christ, notwithstanding
the positive assertion of Saxo (who is supported by some
other chroniclers), that the Redeemer of mankind assumed our nature in
the reign of Frode III. Sweyn Aggo is more rational than his contemporary
Saxo; he rejects all the sovereigns prior to Odin, and commences
his list with Skiold, a son of that deified hero. Undoubtedly Denmark,
like the other states, had its kings before that period; but they were mere
reguli, perpetually at war with each other in struggling for the ascendancy;
and small reliance is to be placed on their alleged actions, or even
their names. Saxo, in taking as authorities the popular songs of his
country, followed the worst of all guides.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c027' id='f6'>
<p class='c028'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The list of Norwegian sovereigns prior to Odin is, according to the
Landfedgatal, the same as for Denmark. These sovereigns, however, in
neither case reigned in the north; they were regarded as Asiatic: it was
Odin who first left the country of his ancestors, and established his empire
in Scandinavia. In this view there is no inconsistency between that record
and Saxo, who does not enumerate the Asiatic monarchs, and who confines
himself to the native princes that held the country for ages before Odin
was known. These, we have strong reason to infer, were <i>not</i> Gothic, but
Finnish, or Jutish, or Lapponic, or whatever else was the denomination of
the people who originally possessed the north. Sweyn Aggesen, therefore,
by rejecting them, evidently confines himself to the foreign or Gothic
dynasty—the dynasty of the conquerors.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>Our English Universal History, like Sunning and Torfœus, adopts these

<p class='c028'><i>According to the</i> Langfedgatal, <i>which is derived from Norwegian authorities,
while Saxo follows the metrical songs and traditions of Denmark</i>:—</p>

<p class='c028'>Odin, Skiold, Fridleif I., Frode I., Havar, Frode II., Vermund, Olaf,

Harald, Sigurd I., Ragnar Lodbrog, Sigurd II., Harda Canute, Gormo the
Aged, Harald II., Sweyn.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>And thus, in about twenty different lists which we have examined, there
is only diversity, or rather confusion. Those of modern date are not more
uniform. Thus Mallet</i>:—</p>

<p class='c028'>The dates of these reigns in the modern histories of Denmark—for the
ancient ones do not condescend to such trifles—are beautifully confounded,
sometimes a whole century being assigned to a single reign.</p>

<p class='c028'>The authors admit that they have omitted several names, probably from
a doubt whether the kings in question ever reigned. Yet some of the

Indeed there is proof for this conjecture.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
